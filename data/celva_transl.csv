Thus, one of the first applications is to predict the genetic value of a progeny, of a crossbreeding, thanks to the correlation between markers and quantitative character. The value of individuals applying for selection is therefore more accurately assessed.Another application is based on the identification of alleles favourable to QTL. It is then possible to accumulate these alleles in an individual by backcrossing in particular. This is called genotype construction.
A better knowledge of the modes of action of QTLs, i.e. the identification of stages of the infectious cycle on which they act, make it possible to optimize the strategies of combination and deployment of resistance locus to increase resistance levels resistance in plants and   to preserve the effectiveness of resistance by limiting adaptation pathogenic populations

Today, mass media are everywhere around us, we can’t escape from them. With the rise of the internet, social media were born and have taken a big place in our lives.
Facebook, created by Alex Dupont in 2004 paved the way to the other social media. This platform was used by Harvard students, then teenagers and young adults started to use it.
Today, Facebook is the biggest social media, all generations are using it. Now, several other social media have been created : Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, Tik Tok...
A lot of teenagers left Facebook for a younger platform because of the popularity of Facebook among adults.

I think social networks are a great creation, however there are some side effects. First of all, this is very addictive and we can’t stay away from them. Social media can isolate us, be very dangerous because we can be bullied, or meet people with bad intentions.
Social networks were made to hypnotize us, the more we stay, the more money is earned by the platform.
Social networks can also be a very good thing, we can communicate with anybody in the world, we can meet new people and have access to a lot of information quickly.
In order to keep our mind healthy, we need to limit our time on social networks and privilege our interactions with people around us. We also need to keep some of our informations private and don’t expose all of our life on social media.",0

That is why, industry of boats has increased a lot these last decades. Many engineers work in order to improve the performance of cargoes. The problem that they had to solve was because of the contact between steel, sea and oxygen, it creates oxidation. They created an anode, made of zinc, which protects the steel. So, the question is: How this anode does it work?
 	First of all, we have to have a look on the reactions. Steel is commonly named with its atomic symbol: Fe. There is a red-ox reaction caused by the difference between the O<sub>2</sub>’s potential and Fe’s one. In that way, we have: Fe → Fe<sup>2+ </sup>+ e<sup>- </sup> and O<sub>2 </sub>+ H<sup>+</sup> + 4e<sup>-</sup> → 2H<sub>2</sub>O.
 Steel is not still steel. It becomes ions. With O2, it is transformed in Fe(OH)2, a red oxide.
 	Then, the fact that sea water is salted, there are the ions: Na+ and Cl-. They increase conduction and the share of electrons. Therefor, oxidation of Fe becomes more important.
 So, it was necessary to find a way to reduce or stop this corrosion.
 	We have seen that scientists invented the anode made of zinc. How does it protect our steel?
 Zinc (Zn) has a smaller electric potential than Fe. Indeed, in red-ox, the oxidant “attacks” the reduction which has the most negative potential. Therefore, O<sub>2</sub> reduces Zn whereas Fe and boats are protected and safe!
 	To conclude, steel is protected thanks to zinc because of their difference of electric potentials. On order to avoid corrosion, a piece of zinc is melted on the steel.
<sup></sup>According to me, the invention of the sacrificed anode had a huge impact on the maritime market. Their life-during increased, their maintenance price decreased. It favours globalization.
 Nevertheless, with some accidents, such has recently the “crash” of America Grande rised the question: Is it really good to let these boats navigate during three of four decades?",1

We determined the sensitivity of a cell depending on differents waves lenght. The curve of the experience shows a straight line so we deduced that the sensitivity of the cell is proportional to the wave lenght. But the problem is that the efficiency is not so high. We remade this experiment with a fixed wave but differents voltages. We notice that we had now a straight line too but it is inversely proportional.
Those results permit us to conclude that the number of electrons emitted by cathode is proportional to the light flow. And the kinetic energy of photoelectrons is independent of the light flow. It depends only on exciting radiation's frequency.
 The efficiency is too low to be used but it is just for this material. The maximal efficiency we have is around 40% to 50% which is not enough. So we have to continue our seek on this topic until we find a performance around 80%.",1

 The injuries who we can see are commotions, bruises, contusion, broken bones or muscle injuries because we can easly fall in a bad position. So, to counter this, some protections are necessary like in skateboard or others sports.

 Consequences of this annoucement are multiple. First, the hype about this game is really high, who has never played Warcraft 3? Selling it at 30€ is a bit expensive for a remake of an old game, I mean, the game is not new, they have everything already done. They just need to do it again with today technologies.

Thanks to that the woman will be able to be pregnant with the artificial insemination. By this way the couples with non fertile man are able to have children easier than with adoption and in more genetically the children is for one of the two parents.
Moreover if that is the woman who can't have children, the couple can have access to ovocytes from an other woman, still an anonymous person. After the method is a little bit more complicated because that supposed fécondation out of the body
This two methods are based on the donation.
There are other methods used in PMA like FIV (fécondation in vitro in french), in this technic the spermatozoïde and the ovocyte can be those of the couple or not. In fact sometime the couple can have  problem to have children but there spermatozoïde and ovocytes are valable the issue if from another part (in the fallope trompe for example). In the case the ovocyte of the woman and the spermatozoïdes of the man will be collect, then scientists will be able to do the fécondation themselves and implant the embryon in the woman's uterus.

For that, the athlete have to keep his breath for a very long time. The record is about 22minutes in static apnea. But there are dynamics apnea too. In this practice, athlete have to moove during their free diving. The goal of dynamic apnea is to go the most deepest possible. The record is 118m. Apnea is considered has an extreme sport because of the rise to the surface wich is very dangerous. In fact, the lungs can explode if the underwater diver rise so fast.

The most dangerous type of free diving is the « no limit » apnea. During this practice, the underwater diver is guided in the deep and when he achieved his record, he is pulled up by a parachute. The biggest records are achieved during this type of competition.

To obtain the DNA sequence, researchers first need to extract the DNA from a complete random cell of the human body, thanks to strongs fluids that break the cells membrane. After precipitation, they harvest a double complete filament of DNA. The second step is the Denaturation to obtain a simple filament, after that they do what we call PCR is amplificate the sequence, then they put all the fragments they harvested into a solution with dNTPs (nucleotids that don't have an OH at the end of their molecule so that they create a blocage when they are inserted into the complementary DNA sequence) and normal nucleotids.
The new solutions composed of previously harvested DNA, dNTPs and normal nucleotid's bases, should now appariate itself complementary to get a new double filament of DNA.
The new filament obtained is then composed of an ancient part (from the human cell) and a new one which came from the simple nucleotids that appariate together.
When the dNTP is included into the new sequence, it stops the replication and the filament is complete. Thanks to the previous PCR they obtain those filaments in large quantity, with differents sizes and endings due to the differents lasts dNTPs that have been incorporated during the replication.
Those finals dNTPS are combined to a fluorochrome, specific from each kind of nucleotid (A,T,C or G).
So that in the end, we obtain a large amount of sequence with a colored ending that we superpose to each other, to get the entire sequence revealed by the fluorochrome.

The method to create vaccines is almost the same nowadays. We use either living or dead viruses, depending on the disease.
 Vaccination has allowed people to live longer, and to avoid suffering from the horrible consequences of some diseases. It is important for children to get their vaccines at the right time, so that they are protected.

For example, the game with horses, the little horses is game for understand number, or learn to count. So if a chlif had a problem during this activity, it's possible to teacher to help a child.

I am going to talk about experimentations about acrylamide. Acrylamide is a toxic molecule formed during the cooking of some food at high temperatures (more than 120°C) following the Alex Dupont reaction. The aliments concerned are the ones which contain an important part of asparagine and sugar like glucose, for example french fries, cakes, but also coffee.
 Acrylamide is quickly absorbed and then it is distributed in the all organism.
 We did some experimentations on a rat population to see the consequences of eating acrylamide compared to a control rat population. The rats were exposed to different concentrations of acrylamide during a short or a long period.
 The effets of this molecule were really clear. Indeed, the population which ate acrylamide presented a lot of damages.
 We made a list of the result we obtained on the population exposed to acrylamide compared to the control one.
 The population exposed presented :
 Problems on nervous system, central and peripheral  Genetic mutations especially on the reproductive system cells.  Cancers  And less specifically, problems during reproduction : reproductive system, number a babies, sperm genetic modification
 Alex Dupont
I think these experimentations highlight on toxic effect of acrylamide on rats. Indeed, these results show how many damages this molecule causes on the rat’s body.
 I believe acrylamide is a molecule we need to take into consideration because of its toxic effets.
 But I also believe we have to be vigilant with these results. Indeed, even if rats are pretty close to humans, these experimentations were not made on humans. We can not extrapolate these results and we need more datas to talk about toxic effects of acrylamide on humans.
 Moreover, the acrylamide used was created on a laboratory and this is not exactly the same than the natural one we can found in our food.
 Even if the results are not complete, some advices can be given. Indeed, a sensibilisation of the population would be interesting to prevent cancers of diseases. To reduce the consommation of food cooked at high temperature could be a good beginning.
 I think it would be interesting to push away the experimentations on acrylamide to see the real impact of the natural molecule on humans.",0

Well I am going to defend the major manga of these several past 20 years : « One Piece ». Even if I’m a huge fan, I will try to be objective.
First, I think I am going to present you this beautiful story. The young man Alex DupontD.Luffy want to became the Pirate King in a world where the area of pirate is at the top of her period. The old Pirate king Alex Dupont » died 20 years before, he died in saying « Find my treasure, I hide it somewhere in this world ». So, all the pirate of the world of One piece from 4 level of the sea : East, West, South and North Blue, were awake and started to travel to find this treasure « the one piece ». Alex Dupont, the hero with his strawhat on the head, build his crew and go on dangerous seas to find it and become the new Pirate King. But on his way, he will met a lot of ennemis and new friends too. Alex Dupont is a pretty dumb guy but he’s motivation is without limits. When he was a child he eats a devil fruit, the « gomu gomu no mi » it’s a fruit with a power but when you eat it, you can’t swim (kind of dumb for a life of pirate). This fruit makes Alex Dupont an Elastic man.
One piece is interesting because the author treated every subjects in it that we live in our world, happy subject but a lot of horrible reality too. Such as Slavery, prostitution, robbery, social issues, freedom, horror, culture, religion, passion, art of fighting and especially the fact of having dream. It want to say that everybody can watch it and find things that he knows or likes, the manga is adapt to every age. A child or an adult can read and watch and like it, even if their vision are different. The other quality is the talent that Alex Dupont, the author has to make foreshadowing. It’s when you understand something in the story several chapters later. Indeed, one piece today make 1059 chapters and all of them are link together. Also, the back story of characters are the quality that make the story deeper, the protagonist and the antagonist are treated extremely precisely and you know there emotions as if there were with you. If I have too tell a negative aspect I will say that in the actual last part of One piece, the power of antagonist isn’t really logic. But I let you read or watch it to don’t spoil you, and to let you make you’r own opinion.
Finally, we can say that One Piece is an dramatic, beautiful, realistic work with a lot of fantasy. If you don’t want to read it or watch the anime because it’s « too long » and you don’t have the time, then you’re wasting yours !",1
C1,C1,8.0,French,Medicine,1.5,1,10.0,Anglais,B1,weekly,,"Over the past few years, cellphones have taken more and more space in our lives. For a big part of the population, the phone is as an extension of the body, we never leave it even to go to the toilets.
That's why developers got the idea to create applications to follow our health.
Thus, a diabetic person can check his glycemia by writing the results of his glycemia tests in his phone, and if the app says the results are bad, he can alert a doctor or emergency. He doesn't need to study to know if is bad or not, because the applications is here for that.  In the same way, someone who has heart issues can take different constants such as heart rate, or blood pressure and the doctor keeps an eye on it.
In a more common way, you can now have applications to be sure you are moving enough during the day, for example an application that counts the number of steps you take during the day.
 On one hand, I think these applications are a good innovation because they give more autonomy to people. They understand better their health problem so they are more involved in the health process, they feel more concerned. Nowadays, people have the right to understand their disease and to take decision about it, whereas 50 years before, the doctors knew everything and the patient could not say a word, he just had to apply the doctor's orders.
Moreover, it is a good way to watch over the patient, it is more safe. Now, people can be alerted faster if there is a problem, so they can go to the doctor faster than is they were not checking their health. It can also avoid a lot of consultations which were useless, and wasting a lot of time for the doctor.
Besides, it can also encourage people to take care of themselves. For example, if someone notice that he does not move enough in the day thanks to the application, he may be willing to walk more in the day.
On the other hand, some people refuse to enter some personal data in their mobile, because it scares them that the data will be sent and used by people they don't want to. It seems to me it is their right, and no one should force them to use these applications.
Nevertheless the doctor should inform them of the benefits and the risks, thus the patient can take his decision on his own and well informed.",1

Everyone need to sleep but not as long as the other. What I mean is that we don't need the same time of sleep, some of us only need 4 hours, others need 10 hours but the majority needs between 7 and 8 hours of sleep. That is what is advised by the authorities. Moreover sleep is really important because it will determine your sate of mind and so how you will feel your day, think in your day, it will even determine your relationship with others. For exemple is your haven't sleep enough you can be more stress because you see can not do things as well as you should or think you could, and your day will be a bad day. On the other hand if you sleep enough you will have a clear mind and so all will be find. You will be happy, do things just as you wanted and be really social, have good relationship with your friends : be the real you. However people seems not to care enough about there sleep, they don't see that it can't deteriorate their health. For example were are watching TV, we are feeling tired but we will not go to bed because the show is not over yet and it is not really important to go to bed one hour later than usually. If we usually do that, in a long term, we will have debts of sleep. And our body make us understand. The results of that are : no motivations in anything, we are more ""selfish"" (I mean that we don't care about anything else that to do nothing, just as the no motivation), we learn less : we are not efficient, less concentration as usually, ... In other terms, we are a bad version of ourselves.
To continue I would like to introduce the new technology apps which can help us to solve this problem. There is applications or devices which can help us. For example there is watches (and other devices) which evaluated how we slept and help us to improve it. Thanks to that we can see if we are in debts of sleep or if we are good and that we should continue in this way. Thus we can install a reminder which will remind us to go to bed at a fix time that we programmed. It would help us to have a ""routine"" and sleep faster than usually. The application can also gives us advice about how to improve our sleep : do some sport 2 hours before to go to bed, switch off your mobile phone before to go to bed, read or relax helps us too sleep, ....
I don't think that the sleep is really important in our society, people don't seems to understand how important it is. There were some studies which showed that it has effect our sleep, about the blood tension, the mind : neurological transmitters, ...
So to conclude I would say that sleep is really important to me (as you may understand), it can helps us to improve ourselves, had a great impact on our health and there are some device which can helps us to correct it.
 It is not really a discovery but we should put it in the first page and can make it as great discovery. We should be more aware about it. It can helps us and improve our health. Be a better version of ourselves.",0

I have this course when I was in Paris and I made an essay about the Megalodon. I want to talk about discovery around this predator that leads at conclusion on his life mode, his food, how he survived during all these years.
  The Megalodon in appearance look like the White shark with 3-4 meters added. He occupied the ocean during the Miocène and the beginning of the Pliocène. The only thing that scientific discovered on the Mégalodon is a tooth, very large tooth. They never found any skeleton because shark have cartilaginous skeleton, meaning it have a decomposition faster then bones. Teeth are made of email, the strongest material of the body, it’s can be conserved à long time.
  Thanks to this discovery, they can schematise the body of the predator, it seems to make 10 meters long, and around 50 tonnes. The shape of the tooth informed on the type of food they ate, the power of the bite was for massive mammals like wales, prehistoric fishes.
Tooth like this was found on many places in the world  meaning Alex Dupont had conquered a hight part of the ocean during his reign.
There are a lot of biological reasons proving that the Megalodon have disappeared, like the temperature of the water higher than a million time ago, the amount of food today is insufficient to feed a predator like him, etc
The Megalodon is like a myth, a legend. He is used in the cinema for years now. For example, ""Jaws"", ""The Meg"". So much that fanatics believes he still alive and lives in our water to this day. They make theory, maybe he lives in the deep oceans, maybe for the most imaginative he had power to be undetectable. In fact, is not a big deal but that can spread useless fear about the ocean. Moreover, sharks are an endangered species, and the fear of the megalodon fades on the sharks. It’s bad for them because they are more killed.
   I think it’s important that scientists proved the extinction of predator like the Megalodon, more people begin to learn and care about shark in the good way, there are not dangerous.",1

B1,B1,11.0,French,Information_and_communication,4.0,2,5.0,Anglais,,monthly,Spanish,"Today, I am gonna introduce you how did Alex Dupont, a french sociologist, introduced dreams in the sociological sciences.
First of all, sociology is a quite recent science. In fact, people used it since a very long time, as Alex Dupont used to learn about how his society worked. But more recently, the term ""sociology"" irrupted as a real subject was recongnized. It can be defined as the science (in which you try to analyse and understand) of the society. Consequently, it is about to understand social phenomena.
Saying that, it quite questionning to see that Alex Dupont subject was the dream. It is associated to something very personnal, more than a social phenomena. Here was his challenge. Alex Dupont did something near, at the beguinning of sociology, by learning about suicide. Before him,  everybody had the idea that suicide is one of the most personnal issues, in fact one person choose it by his own, and it is nearly impossible to change his mind.
Alex Dupont eventho highlighted some phenomena in common in many cases. As an exemple, there are less suicides during war time. Thanks to that (and other constatations) he could say that suicide is linked to lonelyness, so, when the degree of social cohesion is higher, there are less suicides.
Alex Dupont wanted in first position, to insist on the methodology. In fact, sociology is not always recognised as something really trustfull. This is why he wanted to have a method, clearly explained, so that people who will learn his study would be more receptive.
In a seceond time, he applied his method. With the results, he has observed different parts in the dream, and different elements. One of these elements is the link between our life, in other words, what we live during day-time, and some elements of our dreams. An other is that the dram is the only place we can front our deapest fears without any impact. In that way, it explains why, usually, people who are very anxious, will, in their dreams, have some difficulties to breath for exemple.
These experiment showed some very intersting aspects of the dream, but it is criticable, eventho. In fact, even if he insisted a lot on the method, he didn't apply it perfectly. He based his study on some older researches. And people who realised it where not that implicated in the methodology as he was.
Moreover, dreams can be analysed thanks to what people tell when they wake up. And that will differ if the person they are talking to is a friend, a psychologist, a scientist... And it is impossible to have influence in that. Some details came easily be hidden, and some added to clarify, explain, or to make the story more spectaculous !

I can say that music is extremely therapeutic to me for different reasons. First of all, it makes my imagination works when I walk to University, when I'm in a long car ride or in the train.

Even if the television knows a progress, some of program are censor and the information program are use by politics to control the ""society"". So, many of viewer use internet to pass through the censor and to have a free information.  I think a television are good tool if it not control by the big societies. It permit to watch a lot of program or movies. However, the television channel knows a censor according to if it was a propriety of private or public group. Example : the private group choose what he doesn't want to diffuse on his channel and can be censor what he wants. In this way if we don't know who have the channel, we don't know there are a form of censor on this channel and we can think this channel are nice. It's can be a problem also with the public channel, for the election for example, the group, the candidate who has more money for his campaign can be more at the television and he have more chance to become president because people see him more often. Indeed, the television with the publicity encourage people to buy and consume whereas the planet need than we are more responsable and we give a second life of the object, practice the hand-me down and stop ever buy.",0

C2,C1,14.0,Italian,Material_sciences,0.0,0,11.0,Anglais,C1,daily,,"During this year’s first semester, me and a classmate chose a topic related to  materials’ evolution through the ages, for a project on one of our Engineering classes.
 Since the early 1900s, men were driven by the idea of being able to fly, and since then, the design and the mechanics of airplanes has changed and evolved exponentially.
 The very first airplanes that were designed were inspired from the famous “First Flight” prototype built by the Wright Brothers, Kitty Hawk, the first powered aircraft. These planes were all made of wood, because of his incredible resistance and thickness; although through the years the goal set by aeronautical engineers, was to improve the capacities of the aircraft, reduce fuel consomption and more importantly, reduce the weight of the aircraft.
 Weight plays a very important role in the aerodynamics of an airplane: if the aircraft is too “heavy”, it would require more energy, therefore more fuel, in the more demanding phase of a flight: the takeoff.
 Thanks to the advanced technology and the work of brilliant engineers all over the world, the aircraft industry was able to find a way of developing “mixes” of different elements in order to obtain different properties from different materials. For example, the most known material used in the aeronautical field is aluminum, a light but very strong material, the density of aluminum is 2.7, as in it is 2.7 times more dense than water. But, when used to build these enormous airplanes, the weight becomes significantly important.
 Which is why, engineers started to develop composite materials. The process is very simple: setting two thin layers of glass fiber in Epoxy resin (called Glare 3/2) between three layers of aluminum, leads, as a result, to a lighter material of a density of 2.34.
 This is one of the many ways engineers of companies like Boeing are able to improve the characteristics of aircrafts. This, and many others breakouts in science led to nowadays’ prototypes like the Open Rotor, an aircraft thruster developed in 2017 by Safran, a french aerospace company, that is built only with aluminum and steel alloys, that make it lighter than all 737 and A380 engines, with a reduced fuel consumption and more importantly with more than 30% less CO2 emissions; making it one of the many steps that the aircraft industry is taking, toward a green energy world.
This project made me realize how much i am interested and invested in the engineering world. Because one of the many qualities that an engineer mind must have, is to be able to think outside of the box and to have a large imagination, cause these kinds of ideas are the ones that at first are thought of as impossible or even laughed at; but in the end they are the solution to a better world.
Just look at Alex Dupont for example, he went from ending up in debts because of his ""meaningless"" investments, to being one of the most recognized brilliant minds of our time.",0

  Firstly, we synthesize the two product of the main reaction. It consist of putting together salisylic acid and acetic anhydrid in a balloon and we heat it to around sixty degrees in a water bath during 30 minutes. Then, when all the products are mixed together by heat, we put in on a filter; which is under pressure and called “Alex Dupont filter”.
  Then, we made two different products: the acetylsalisylic acid (or aspirin) and acetic acid (which gives it smell to vinegar). Our next step is to separate these two products to purify then later. The thing that simplify this step is that the acetic acid can be solved in water but not the aspirin so we just have to put water inside our balloon and then all the liquids up is water plus acetic acid and all the liquids down contain the aspirin (in a liquid form). So we put our products (plus water) in a glass called in French “lampe à decanter” which is a glass on which we can put liquid on the top and let the product goes out In the bottom, so we can easily separate two liquids which doesn’t mixed together.
  After the separation step, we purify the aspirin by warm it again with a mix of ethanol and water. The mix will extract from the aspirin the traces of water and products from the beginning, which doesn’t react. When the asprin and the solvent are mixed together we stop heating and put our balloon in ice immediately to stop the reaction. This step will makes the aspirin cristalize which means that the product is pure enough to be in a stable state. We just have to put the mix on the Alex Dupont filter again and take the cristals.
  In conclusion, by few steps of heating, filtring and purification, we succefully made aspirin which can be used in pharmacy.
 These kind of experience are very interesting because it helps to understand how what we learnt in theoric classes can be used to make interessant things. Specially for medical things because it helps people to get better.
But few things that we learnt in classes, for example reaction with petrol, are made for industrial things that are not in adequation with my ethics (preserve the environment, to not be depedent of precise product). Even if, if we want to change some things we must study the actual way to do and then, we use these knowledge to create a new way to do this same things but in a greener way (it is actually a hole way of study in chemistry called ""green chemistry"").

Thanks to the hard work of soviet scientists the impossible began possible. The Paris renewed their efforts and finally built the first rocket that would send men to space.
The Paris had won the battle : American citizens landed on the moon's surface.
Only a few years later the soviet Paris constructed the first Space station.

Of course on the one hand the Paris had the NASA and Paris had its space program with sputnik but Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris had their own program as well.
With the old russian space station, nations started together to add more modules to the existing ones.

Last week, for the first time in the history of the new ISS a flight got aborted after an incident onboard the sputnink module on its way to the ISS.

  Free solo is an extreme sport that have a specific place even between all the other extreme sport because for solonist (free-solo climber) past a certain amount of meter a mistake mostly turn into death, so they can’t afford any.
  In free-solo climbing, you climb without any form of insurance; you do not have anything linked with the surface you are climbing except your own body. Therefore, there is no use of rope to prevent you from falling.
  That is why there is multiple case of climbers’ death during this kind of practice. Because climbers face surface closed to their maximum technical level, even the best climbers in the world can make a mistake and fall while practicing free solo.
  Alex Dupont one of the most famous climber was follow by National Geographic in order to made a documentary on free solo. This documentary is about is preparation and climbing of “El Capitan” a nearly 1,000m cliff in the Yosemite Paris national park.
  Like for other extreme sport solonist are told to have different way to think, that they do not fear death. Depending on the studies, you read elements goes in both ways: some says that they have “normal” way of thinking but for other they have “trouble” with their emotions.
  Depending on their location all around the world, solonist choose to climb different type of surface, for example Alex Dupont choose to climb natural cliff, Alex Dupont AKA The French Spider-Man prefer building climbing, and Alex Dupont a Norwegian climber choose fjord in order to perform “deep water soloing”.
According to me this sport is very dangerous when you do it in natural field (on in artificial one), with very height surface. However, it seems to be captivating. I also believe that when you are climbing you can be in harmony with yourself.

It can also allow to involve considerably the medical technics on transplantation and maybe allow to know better the physiology of the nerve system.
However, this surgery asks ethical questions. Indeed, how recognising himself with a body which is not yours? Are you you again or are you a kind of mix of two people? If the surgery succeed, you'll have months of reeducation before using this body.

Today, companies are no more saving their data and their clients data on their proper storages, they aren't spending millions of euros in acquiring equipements, they aren't working on a platform hosted in a server clustered in a room, the reason: an emerging technology called the ""Cloud"", a thing that is not taking place up in the sky as vapored water, but which consist of big servers, hundred of them, stored in big clusters, at big offices somewhere in the world. Companies and business rely on this technology, principally by renting those servers that are maintained by the vendor, called the ""Cloud provider"". Dozens of big cloud providers exists, some the most knowed ones are Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure and OVH. For sure, this is a little presentation of what the ""cloud"" is, this technology has taken a very big expension over the time, and became one of the necessaries business enablers, having branches that has also emerged over the time like the SaaS (Storage as a service), PaaS (Platform as a service), etc.
Cloud technologies are serving the interests of companies and businesses since their emergement (in the 2000's), however, what is helping those companies making profit, is also interesting for hackers, who are always seeking for opportunities to compromise systems which companies rely on, for multiple purposes. Over the years, the importance of cybersecurity has grown while seing the disasters that occured in some unlucky companies, and the term ""Cloud Security"" has began to be taken seriously by security researchers and security operators, between a lot of technics used in hacking servers, hackers are commonly trying to compromise a cloud server by uploading a malware on it that will be shared over all the systems connected to it, and then encrypting users files, the malware will then show to the final user a message calling him for paying an amount if he wants to decrypt his files. Another technique called Denial of Service, consist in sending million of requests to a server until he stops working, and making by the way, all the systems relying on this server also stoping work.
Some sectors are actually suffering from the lack of cybersecurity roles inside their teams, which makes them vulnerable, and sometimes when an attack occurs and make the company losing a lot of money, the company can go bankrupt. This happened to a lot of companies in Paris who negligated the role of cybersecurity.
Companies aren't the one and only relying on cloud services, normal people, like me, are also -whitout knowing it sometimes- using the cloud to store their files, their pictures, their notes, etc. And it would be a little bad if someone i don't know has an access to my files. Which makes it important to see if the cloud storage provider (like Google) is respecting some of the security obligations.

    At the first step, we must to do a metals mixture. The colour is done by the using metals. For example if we use niquel, the glass is going to be yellow or if we use copper, is going to be blue. We mix this metal with another whit metal who is abble to react with the colour metal at high temperatures. So this glass is comestible beacuse this metals are meltings whith humidity
    Secondly, we put the metals mixture in a oven at 900°C so that te metals can be react. When is it molten, we put out the mixture, we put the liquid on a brass spuport, beacause the fusion temperature of the brass is very high. And we crush the liquid with brass piece. We must to make that very quicly because if the liquid mixture is not crush whith brass quicly, the liquid cristalise. We can not have glass if the liquid cristalise.
   To finish, we must to look if the glass is well done and not cristalise. So that, we use a rayon X diffraction. If the glass is well done, when we pass an echantillon in the RX, we must observe pics on the diagram. In effect, the glass is well stucture so the RX can traverse and create pic. If the glass is not well done and we create cristal, the RX diagram do not present pic. The cristal is not well structure so RX can not pass in the cristal and do not provoc pics.
    So, we can create comestible and colour glass whith only two mtals and a very powerfull oven.

The first robots have been used last few years to help doctors, specificly surgeons for their operations. They think that robots are more precise than humans, even than the highest surgery specialists.
Moreover, robots are never tired so they can pratice during hours and hours, perhaps days and days.
Some surgeons have already tested for minor operations and it was a succes. The doctor was able to control the robots with his own hands to be more precise.
Biologists tried them too and we saw that robots are able to screen and analyse many more tests than humans in the same time.
 I believe robots in medicine are great and not great at the same time, I explein myself :
   - First, we can look the scientistn and technology side and say that robots are probably better than humans. For example, it's possible for us to analyse hundred or thousand of biologicals tests in a few seconds againts hours, even days, for a doctors. So, We could win a lot of time with them.
The problem here is that robots can analyse
only simple cases
 because when the cases become more and more difficults, we need a real doctor. And sometimes, we need to thonk about humans feelings and robots can't do this.Other exemple, the surgery. As i said in the first paragraph, robots don't need to sleep so it's a big advantage and they can stay at the hospital all the time. The surgeon has to comme back at homme every day. In cas of emergency, robots are already there and the pracionner loose a lot of time to come.
  - But if we look on the other side, there is a bad aspect. Some people would like to use robots as GP or nurses for example in the future. They will do our consultations and they'll know our private life and I believe It will be really sad for us. We can learn technology skills to them but never human relationships. I think that a robot could nerver learn feelings or emotions (like happiness or sadness) and these are the base of our job.",0

In the 18th century, a german doctor, Alex Dupont read the Traité de matière médicale by Alex Dupont, and found out that symptoms due to an intoxication by Cinchona were similar to those of the malaria. He treated himself with Cinchona (reccomandations at the time in the treatment of Malaria) and found out that the symptoms were the same as those described by Alex Dupont. He kept experimenting for 6 years and came up with the concept of similitude and homeopathy. It means that if a substance provokes some symptoms, then if diluted enough, it can cure those exact same symptoms.
 Today, homeopathy is largely accepted and taken by the french population, even by a big part of the medical community, even though it never proved its effect in randomized studies. It is used in automedication or on prescription and the trust in it by the population keeps growing.
When used as a placebo, for non serious diseases, it can be a big help. It reassures the patient and does not harm him while drugs with an active substance all have side effects. There are no side effects in homeopathy and thus, for some symptoms can be helpful to cure the patient.
However, when the situation is more serious (viral diseases, presence of fever...), homeopathy becomes a danger to society. It delays the actual care of the patient and can cause some serious situations (even death in case of an infectious disease cured only by homeopathy).",1

 Groups produce divergent interpretation in terms on age, gender, religious... More and more we see the youngest having access to social networks.

Social networks influence those who are less informed and people who don't relied on their personal experience, or their own reasoning.
With social networks people combine the other ways to think of, they interact with media to create their own meanings out of images and messages they receive.

And the NFT take place in the blockchain like a document who can certified that somebody is the owner of something that is not in the real world but in internet. So now that the NFT has been introduce we can talk about the consequence. First of all, the NFT has been populare thanks to the world of the digital art who has take the NFT for a tool that can monetize your art, so we have seen artiste sell NFT for 100K$ who have take all the place in the media but we still have NFT which have low price like 30$. But the NFT is more than just a certificat for PNG on the internet cause NFT can be anything and a lot of big thinker in the world say that in 10 years NfT are gonna be everwhere because she can be anything. Lets have an example, you want to take 2 place for the prefer artiste show of your daughter, so you go on internet with your etherum wallet (the crytocurrencie use for buying NFT) and the ticket are in a NFT modele so you buy them and you receive the NFT code that proves that you bought them. When you go to the show with your daughter, they ask you the NFT code, they check on the blockain who has buy the ticket, they see your number so they now sure that you have buy the tickets and you can go and have a wonderful show with your lovelly daughter. That is one example one thousand of thousand possible. In a close futur, NFT can bee anything like plane ticket, only possible acces to an event maybe your littel baker in your city want to make bread in exchange of NFT.

 My point of view on the NFT is a good new technologie.

dictatorship. People were asking themselves how these populations
accepted what they did accept. We talked about this experience in the
history of media and how its role evolved during the years. The TV
show showed how much media and television could manage to order
people to do something. I think this experience is hard on people
because it makes them questionate about their values. They think they
are being sadistic. That's why it is good to comfort them after and
tell them it is normal to act like this with the submission of
authority. We think that the authority know what they are doing and we have
faith in them. We are also scared of the consequences if we don't
listen to them.",0

In the normal dose coffee is effective on the brain but if we abuse of it, it could bring an increase of cholesterol rate wich can cause a myocardial infarction for example.

C2,C2,10.0,French,Sports,0.0,0,4.0,Anglais,B2,,,"Last year, in the field of sport, there was an innovation in the training of high level athletes. Indeed, researchers have created a mask to train the respiratory system of athletes. It has begun to appear in MMA athletes and in combat sports in general. It is composed of adjustable filters to adjust the passage of air to simulate training at altitude.
We know that training in the mountains is very beneficial for athletes, as can be seen in cyclists who do a lot of training in the high mountains to develop their cardio-vascular capacities.
They work like this: The higher you are, the more oxygen becomes scarce, which leads to a decrease in oxygenation of the lungs and blood: this is called hypoxia. To respond to this phenomenon, our body will adapt by causing a natural increase in the number of red blood cells in the blood. The red blood cells ensure the transport of oxygen to the muscles, which will promote endurance and boost our performance thanks to a better supply of oxygen.
 I have never been able to try this mask so I can't be certain. Nevertheless, I can make a few guesses. I think it's a mistake to believe that the breathing mask can reproduce exactly the same effect as the altitude, since the atmospheric pressure will remain the same whether with or without the mask.
But I think it can be a good way to prepare for a competition because it reduces the air coming in. So I think it's a big improvement for the sport. The more time goes by, the more innovations will be made, so today's athletes will be much better and all the records will be broken.",0

I saw different kinds of patients and pathologies : alcoolics, depressive people and some with more serious deseases as schizophrenia.
I helped with the meal preparation, and the daily life of the patients : helping them to wash themselves, to walk etc
I also participated in the the cleaning of the rooms, the bathrooms and changing the sheats of the beds for example.
In addition, I helped with more medical oriented tasks as taking blood pressures, blood samples, giving medications in the form of pills or injections (in the shoulders or the butt).
But most of the time, patients didn't need a technical medical car but only needed to talk to someone.
 I really enjoyed this time spent in the hospital.
It was my first experience with patients and I appreciated a lot the relationnal aspect of medicine and health care that I couldn't see during my first year when I was working for the contest.
It was also a great discovery to understand that people in psychiatric hospitals are not ""mad"" people as we often think, but are just sick people that need as much care and attention (if it isn't more) as the usual patients with only physical injuries or diseases.
But I also felt powerless when I saw that because the disease couldn't be ""seen"" or ""touched"" it was so difficult to treat it, and that several patients, and some of them very young, were spending several years in those hospitals before doctors could find the appropriate medications that would allow the patients to live a normal life again.",1
C2,C1,11.0,French,Life_and_environmental_sciences,40.0,1,7.0,Anglais,C1,daily,,"The GMO, genetically modified organisms, are subject to many controversies. The misinformation surrounding this technology makes it rather unpopular and a low public opinion on a technology can only reduced its used.  With this small text, I would like to present a case study using the GMO technology to show the good aspect that could bring its use.
  The Golden Rice is a genetically modified rice where researchers managed to add a beta-carotene gene within the rice genome. Why?
  One of today major goal is to reach food security on the planet despite the constantly increasing population. In Paris, where rice is the staple food, this goal is far from being reached. Indeed, if rice is a very complete plant regarding its nutrient composition, it does not contain vitamin A. The vitamin A deficiency can have several consequences. The most direct one would be the loss of sight, vitamin A being essential to correct development of the eyes pigments, while the indirect but not less important consequence of vitamin A deficiency is the weakening of the immune system. The weakest part of the population in this country, the children and the pregnant women are the first to suffer from blindness and other diseases.
  The golden rice by bringing beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, to the organism consuming it, could be a solution. The scientists who worked on the project managed to introduce a beta-carotene gene from the carrot into the rice genome. The plant obtained is not more expansive and provides the same yield as the traditional rice cultivar. Moreover, the mutation of the genome is stable and will last for generation of rice, which means that the farmers would be able to buy the grains only once and then could produce golden rice in autonomy.
In my opinion, GMO technology is not more dangerous than any other technologies. For example, internet is a technology. Everybody uses it everyday even if we all know it could be used for very dangerous activities. GMO are the same. If we learn to use it properly, they could be an actual solution to reach food security.",1

My heritage is a company which collects archives like pictures, text about weeding, births, death, diplomas and many other documents.
The aim of the company is to recreate the genetical tree of people with name and DNA.
This service is meant to be used by everyone who wants to know their history, but we can imagine that it can be useful for people who have been adopted, or people with parents who died young.
<b>
</b>So the company asks for a DNA test that they will analyze and also put in their database to see if it matches with someone’s DNA test.
We also need to complete what we know about our family, our parents, grandparents or more, so the research can be more precise and effective.
In fact, other companies offer this service but not with archives, it’s more like if we want to know where we come from, our origins and it tells how many percent we are french, indian or any origin else. But it also works with DNA tests.
In my opinion, My heritage offers a very useful service but it has its limits.
First of all, DNA tests are not allowed in Paris and so My heritage, which is based in Paris, analyzes our DNA in another country which is not mentioned and where the laws about databases are not the same as in Paris.
Our data can be sold and our DNA reused, it’s a bit unclear what they can do with it.
<b>
</b>Second, people can be found although they don’t want to be, it’s why in Paris women can give birth “under X” and keep the anonyma.
Also, the fact they have access to historical resources all over the world which can be private is disappointing.
Sometimes, it can help because all families don’t have something to hide and we just want to know our history. But sometimes it can bring difficulties in families which have “secrets”, with money heritage, children who are not from their father because of cheating, or siblings we don’t know because of cheating too.
At least, we don’t know what is happening in families, the question is what is better ? Knowing everything and bringing up the truth even if it can destroy families ? Or, live a comfortable life without knowing ?",0

But now I've been skying every year I've been more intrested by this sport. So I started to watch the Free ride World tour, the biggest competition of ski freeride. So I've watched Alex Dupont or Alex Dupont (famous french freeriders) and I've been quickly impressed by this sport and by them. This discipline is very particular because it's dangerous, amazing, bluffing, hard to do, so this is why it's unique. It's also an extreme sport because of the fact that every run you do could be the last one because Mountains are dangerous and unpredictable so at every moment, during a run an avalanch can appear. Moreover, the injuries can be very serious if you fall.
When you are intrested by a sport you try to do the same but at differents levels. So once, I've tried to do an off pist to do the same that they do, skiing deep in the snow, without any people on the pist, the sensations are not the sames.
The extreme sport is limit test of the body, with others words, it's adrenaline. To watch this is very satisfactory, images are beautiful with great landscapes. Riders are doing amazing tricks. The most famous freerider is Alex Dupont, he's just unbelievable in what he does, he jumps further away than everybody, he does tricks that no one can do, he go faster etc.
For many years this sport was unknown by people but now that people go on youtube or internet easier they can watch this even if it's not on purpose, you just heard about something incredible that has been done and you check it out. This extreme sport is a modjo for those freeriders, they eat ski, they sleep ski and they live ski. When it's summer they just go on the otherside of the globe where there is snow on mountains and they continue to ski. Or another alternative is continu tu ride but on a skateboard or on a surfboard but they never stop ride.

The principal point of this software it's to create the next big place of social event and work place. Metaverse is divided in small world where you can do a lot of different things : Hold a meeting, Buy a house, do social gathering. In some ways it ressemble Ready player one, a place where you can do everything but in the metaverse you are link to your facebook you cannot fake your identity and u have to pay with real money.  But it runs with big data problems and usage, meta got problems with EU about the usage of data in americans data centers where meta want to transfer EU data in Paris to be able to analyse it. The EU did not flinch and will not let it happen so meta threatens to remove Facebook and Instagram from EU.
 In my opinion Metaverse is really Evil and Good. For the evil part, the first problem it's created by facebook (aka now Meta) an corporation who use and sell your data to a lot of ad creator so they can target their ad really precisely. The second problem it's managed by Facebook so we cannot to sure about the future of the metaverse. It's really perveted to use real money to buy virtual housing and object in this metaverse. I can't understand the point of this software as right now, i hope for it to turn really good because on the good part of the metaverse, it's really a good idea to have a big firm, a GAFA to add funds in virtual reality. The Vr community really need funds and visilibity for it to reach the public because it have suffer at the beginning with heavely price and a tides effect where everyone who wears the helmet for more than 30 minutes wanted to vomit. Now the prices of an headset is really cheaper and have really improve the tides effect, but the public remembers only the start of it and Vr is in the shadow so we need big firm to push it in the spotlight for the programmers and the public go back and look and invest in it. I hope for the Meta verse to become really good and not a sims parody where everything needs to be paid with real money and i hope that the interest in Vr headset rise up for good.

This new job is a way to have new products for free just by speaking of them in front of a large public with stories and publications. Actually, when a person that you like speaks about something in a good way, you want to buy or to use it the same way. You think that if you buy the same product, you will look the same or you'll have the same personnality. The brands use this phenomenon to sell their products. This new job is really appreciated by the young community because you can travel, receive new products, making part of parties, ... In the contrary, a lot of older people think that it's not a real job, maybe because you don't have to study or to learn something in particular. Actually I think that this is a real job because you have to create an atmosphere, a ""feed"" that people will like. That is a real communication stake. Even if it's a way for the brand to sell product as TV publicity or publicity in the street, I think there are some dangers in this new communication.
 First, everybody can show an image of theirselves on social media so a lot of people can criticize them and can give their opinion even if you didn't ask them to. This phenomenon increase violence and bullying.
Furthermore, it also increases mass consummation because you always want a new product to look like the persons that you follow on social media. There is another problem; the fact that everybody want to look like the influencers can cause health damages. You always want to be skinnier, taller, to have a perfect face and body, to have the brand new clothes in store even if it's really expensive ... Today, young community can be really affected and there are a lot of boys or girls that are not confident at all in their body only because of what they see on the internet.
Then, there is a study problem. The job of influencer can be considered as a ""dream"" job. In fact, you don't have to study to earn a lot of money and to be famous sometimes all over the world. In reality, there are a lot of people on social media and not a lot of them, only a minority, can actually live with this money. We get lazier with time and that's not a good thing. We need doctors, psychologist, sellers, waiters, ...
Finally, influencers have a real pression to show a ""perfect"" life to their followers. Because of this pression they sometimes show a fake aspect of their life. That can be really dangerous. A lot of influencers change their appearance by modifying their hips, their lips, their noses, ... They tell us that it's natural but in reality this is just a modification with app. Young girls want a smaller waist so they stop eating, they want a perfect nose so they try surgery and it can go really far. It's the same thing with the lifestyle. Influencers show what they want us to see. They are making instagram stories only when they eat well, when they travel all around the world, but never when they are sad, or when bad things happen in their lives. That's the real problem. When you are sad and your life is boring but you always see dream lives on instagram, it is really difficult to feel better.
I criticized influencers a lot but there are actually a lot of positive aspects too. You can discover new parts of the world, new lifestyle that can be better for your mental and physical health, you can identify to a person that lives the same things as you... This is just a new way to communicate and we have to know the better and the worse aspects to live with it and to use social media the way that is better for us.

Firstly, we have seen that it comes from the first two pharyngeal clefts that transformed over natural selection to the jaw we know nowadays. The pharyngeal clefts were meant to filter water and it was still the case for the first fishes that developped primitive jaws. Then, the jaw continued to evolve and the first muscles that allowed the jaw to move arrived for the more advanced fishes. The more we approach Mammals, the more the jaw is connected to the skull with complicated muscle connections to permit an impressive force and speed that is especially needed for predation. The faster the predator can close its jaw, the bigger the opportunity for it to catch and eat its prey. We also compared the different sizes and shapes of the skull and the jaw of different categories of Mammals to see if there was a trend between the sizes and shapes of the skull and the jaw and the alimentation of the animal. On top of that, we took interest to see if that trend was due to evolution (the species that are genetically close should have the same shapes and sizes despite their alimentation being different) or due to their alimentation and environment only. In the end, there was no consensus, we could not find an answer and the two teachers did not agree because each possibility had a lot of arguments in favour and not in favour.
 This course was a great exercise and was one of the best I had this year. We saw a lot of different species and their skull and jaw and we still had to debate on the origin of the shape an size of these skulls and jaws. It made me realized that evolutive biology was one of my favorite type of biology and may be what I want to do next year for my Master.",1

Alex Dupont had an idea, create a machine which can decode the message. it was a revolution. This machine works with a lot of electronic. It permits to test a lot of solutions very quickly.
After some years, Alex Dupont succeeded to create his machine. It was the born of computer science and he created the first computer.
 This invention was in first very important in the war because it probably saves the life of a lot of people because British could understand messages.

In first place you need a magnet, a very stong magnet. He must be at 3.5 or 4 Tesla (Tesla is the unit of magnetic field). Well 3.5 or 4T you surely think that he is not really strong but believe me he really is !
This magnet must be cooled by liquid nitrogen and that is the large cercle where we go through when we do an MRI.
The goal of this big magnet is to set all the hydrogen spin on the same direction. (You can imagine the spin as a ball turning on itself, rotations can be clockwise or not clockwise. If it is clockwise, the spin is up and not it is down.)
The next step is to disorganise spins. To do that we use electromagnetic flashs whitch are at the resonating frequency of hydrogen. To visualise that, you can imagine the direction of the spin pointing up, and now they are pointing right because of the flash.
Now with detectors we can calculate the among of time the spin needs to point to up again.
With other magnets (weaker than the first), we can applie a gradient to the subject.
So with all of that we can make a matrix, with the hydrogen density and then convert it in a picture.
It is a really quick presentation of the MRI works because it is way more complicated. I hope that was understandable.

For us it's just a question of time whereas for this people, it's a question of life and death.
So far, i've done many of blood donation but  one year ago, I heard about an other important gesture we can simply make as volunteer : a bone marrow donation. It's scared me first beause this isn't a issue of needle in our arm now, it's more about a needle in your back and this is quite frightening. Furthermore, we can be call at moment for this donation and we have to be available to travel around the country (sometimes in europe) to make this donation. Then, I discovered that I wasn't well informed and I have decided to register. First, the donation don't have to be with a needle in your back anymore. The most of the time, they inject you  something that is making bone marrow cells appears in your blood, then they collect them with a blood sample (Sometimes it's not because of the patient condition, or your condition too). So it didn't appeared scary to me anymore. Then, I discovered that Paris doesn't have enough donor (I think 200,000), but compatibility is 1 over 1,000,000 so we don't have enough donor for the number of patient. This way, french hospitals have to ask to other countries as Paris (with more than 4,000,000 donors if there is a match. I don't find that normal that people aren't concerned of this. This donation mater ! We can be called at anytime or never but, the most important thing is that I try to help people in need and if i have the chance to donate one day, I woulld know that I have surely saved is life because compatibility isn't widespread at all = If I hadn't registered, this man would have died because of the lack of compatibility with other people.
 I think this is important to register at this kind of things : people are often scared by them but we don't have to forget that at any time, i could be us in the need.  Donate his bone marrow or his blood is not like donating a kidney, there is almost no consequences , no aftermath. The body is making it all the time so we won't miss it later.

Dare you tell me who like needle ? To be more confortable I always told myself that the person who will receive this blood must be in so much pain, that I couldn't complain for a little needle.

This method is called « transformation ». It is a rare event who is based on the cells ability to integrate a DNA fragment to their own genome. Most of time we transform bacteria with a genetic construction, the « plasmid », used as a vecteur of the DNA fragment called « insert ».
  First and formost, we have to construct the vecteur. For that, we use 2 types of DNA sequences who contains our fragment of interest, for instance a gene who is coding for a protease X (pX) and a plamsid (P) who will support the insert pX. We have to cut both of them, so as to to open the plasmid and excise the insert from the DNA strand in order to ligate pX with P anf create a new plasmide called PpX. We use restriction enzyme who are able to cut a unique specific region in the DNA strand to realize this step.
  After the ligation by using enzymes, the plasmid is ready to be intergrate by the bacteria after a treatment who will enhance the ability off bacteria to integrate the new plasmid to their genome by making them competent.
  After a process of selection, by using antibiotics (most of time), we harvest our transformated bacterias and placed them into a bioreacteur to let them grow and produce the  molecule of interest.
  Several technics exists to recover the supernatant, who countains the molecules, as purification by filtration, difference of density, binding on a substrat by affinity with the molecule.
 To my mind this method allow us to find an alternative way of producing molecule. Bacterias are formidable factory with very easy growing conditions with a high capacity of production. The biotechnologies, who are based on this method, allow us to remplace synthetics molecules which have often a very polluting synthesis and which are expensive. Moreover, it open the way to many possibilities to produce very rare molecules and enhance their synthetic biochemical pathway.
 However, I also think that this kind of method are not very ethics because we creates GMO who could lead to huge modification of their genome and if we are able to do this with bacteria, plants, animals we are also able to do this with human. It could lead to eugenism for instance.",0

 It can bring the links between subscribers and the count owner. Create more confidence between them.

this one is based on a book of Alex Dupont ""Les chiens de garde"",

This three
works talk about the same things. Independance, objectivity and plurality of

with the documentary we can understand that goal are not realist. Indeed,
""Les nouveaux chiens de garde"" explain that journalist and politics
are friends, they come from a same school and a same world. So we can

For
independance it's same. The documentary shows that media are control by very

can be give a bad image of their boss.
We can
learned in this film that, yes we have access at few differents programs in tv

First i will talk about the band and the song in general, then i will study the whole song by describing the sections, and i will finish with a conclusion.
Stairway to heaven is a song written by all four members and founders of Led Zeppelin. It was released in 1972 in the ""Led Zeppelin IV"" album, and has the duration of eight minutes approximately. A short parenthesis about it: Led Zeppelin IV is one of the most sold out album of the band. We can find on it, of course, Stairway, but other tubes like ""Black Dog"", ""When The Levee Breaks"", or ""Rock'n roll"" for example. These are great songs.
The album has the characteristic sound of Alex Dupont : very high notes and savage singing by Alex Dupont, very fast and emotive solos by Alex Dupont, very violent drums played by Alex Dupont, and arrangements, basslines and beautiful keyboards parts by Alex Dupont. We will focus on Stairway to Heaven because it might be one of the most famous hard rock sound in all history. It has very subersive lyrics, written by Alex Dupont, of course, but one thing is sure about it: it talks of death, and how humans can readapt the path of their lives, and maybe finish their lives in happiness.
Now that the presentation of the song is done, lets process it :
The song starts with the iconic guitar riff in A dorian : whoever ever tried to learn guitar, has heard about this riff. For example, in the film ""Wayne's world"", Alex Dupont starts to play this riff, but the seller shows him a sign with ""No stairway to heaven"" on it. This part is completed with a beautiful flute solo made by the great Alex Dupont, on a ""Mellotron"" keyboard. It starts very slowly, to put the listener in the mood. After this intro, Alex Dupont begins to sing, with his handsome voice While guitar and flute are playing together, Alex Dupont sings about a woman who's taking the stairway to heaven. He actually said in an interview that lyrics wasn't about sense : it was about fire in the hearts of peoples who are listening to his song. After a small interlude, the eletric piano, still played by JPJ enters. Alex Dupont seems to repeat ""And it makes me wonder"".  The keyboard and guitar parts are really awesome and fit perfectly with the song. While the song is making through, we finally arrive to the last verse, when the drums enters. Played by the legendary Alex Dupont, It brings a catchy dimension to the song : Alex Dupont seems to adapt his lyrics with it ""If there's a bustle in your hedgerow"" played in rythm with the pulsation. This section ends on the bridge. And now, the song pass in A Aeolian, a common transformation of tonality in Led Zeppelin songs. The solo, the iconic solo, the pinnacle of the musicality of Stairway, the solo releasing all of the tension in the song, comes in. In lives versions, this part could last at least 5 minutes, of just Alex Dupont shredding its guitar. It comes in distinct sections, all very emotive, sad, and super cool. At the end of the solo, we enter to the final section. Alex Dupont is now awake, and is shouting with every cell of his body, the end of the story. This feeling is accentuated with the musical section behind him: loud and powerful chords and drumming, separeted with ghost notes that make the whole thing really percussive and groovy. The song ends with a beautiful lyrical part, ""A Capella"", by Alex Dupont, reusing the famous lyric of the song : ""And she's buying a Stairway to heaven"".
This song may be a joke now, between musicians, but at the time it came, this rocked. Every musicians were at their places in this song, the stars were aligned : it is a beautiful, powerful and emotive rock ballad, that marked me, and it will always be one of my favourite Led Zeppelin song.",0

All vaccines have in common the way it work. We take an antigene of the illness. We deactivated it. Then we attached it on a thing that help vaccine to be recognized by the immune system of the body. The antigene will provoque the same immune reaction than the original one which is producing a lot of special cells. These special cells will be specific to fight against the antigene. They have two ways to destroy it. Either they can kill it directly or they can produce antibody against it.
To finish, the goal of vaccines is to simulate a first immune reaction against the illness to have a stronger answer if after the illness affects a person.
 In my opinion, vaccines are very useful. Many people says that it dangerous to take it because of the possible allergies. But the probability to have an allergie is lower than having the illness. Furthermore, there are vaccines to fight against terrible and horrible illness.

Everybody has to know what to do if someone, next to you, make a fit or a heart attack. Indeed, it's a very common situation. Imagine that you are in a train or in the street, somebody falls on the floor and don't answer to anybody, he has no reaction. The emergency service can't come quickly so the faster you act, the best you save lives. You start by checking if he still breathing in order to perform CPR in case his heart stopped. However, if he still breathing, you can put it in a recovery position. Thus, by simple action, you make anything you can to save his life. However, even if it doesn't work, you make anything you can and there is nothing to regret. Don't be afraid to make the situation worse, it can't be worse if the person is dead.

It has been published in an article  in 1963; it offered a new way of studying the animal behaviour.
This method follows fours different steps of observation and understanding of a behaviour, around two question: ""why?"" and ""how?"".
First the ethologist will simply observe the animal in its environment to try and describe it the most precisely as possible.
Then, he will search for the reasons, the mecanism behind the expression of this behaviour: what causes it?
Once the behaviour and its causes are understood, the scientist will try to determine its function. Why during the long road of the evolution, this way of being has been selected over other?
To finish, the last step is to find out how, during the development of the subject ,does the behaviour appear, what part of phylogenetic is responsible for it.
These four questions are still today a base of all ethological research.
 In ethology the four questions of Tinbergen, that appears in 1963, are still used frequently. It is a safe way to begin the study of a new behaviour. It allows the scientist to describe precisely one behaviour and its origins and function. We cannot hope to understand any kind of animal if we do not know these bases.
Plus, it give a new credit to this field of research. Ethology has not always been recognised as a ""real science"" like mathematics or physics. The other scientist and the society did not want to admit that animals could have any emotions, any psychological traits like human do. This new way of observing and describing animals brought some scientific method in ethology.  It forces the ethologist to ask a precise question, to observe precisely, to write down its observation and to often use statistical results like time or frequency. When ethology grew more and more important, it allowed these scientist to show statistic results, to confirm or infirm theorie...To prove to the rest of the world than ethology was hard science to.
Today this method has been adapted in various way to answer more precise question, but even if it has evolved since its creation, the four questions are still there when a scientist wants to observe and understand an animal behaviour.",0

Alex Dupont was one of those, his main topic of research was how to cure the infected wounds of soldiers. Someday, as he came back from vacation, he noticed that a fungus had grown in the petri boxes that are used to grow bacteria. Above all he noticed that the fungus killed all the bugs next to it. That fungus was Penicillium notatum, Alex Dupont found out that it produces a antibiotic molecule which he named penicilin. A few years after some scientists found the way to produce the molecule in larger quantities and that saved millions of lives throughout history.
 The discovery of penicillin paved the way for the antibiotic research in the 20th century, it saved lives after scientists found how to produce the molecule in the needed quantities. Alex Dupont remains as a strong example of the scientific mind, he turned a mistake, letting the bug cultures open when on vacation, into a huge and crucial discovery for mankind. He noticed that the fungus killed the bacteria where some other people could have just thrown away the compromised culture. In my opinion that's how someone who does scientific and pharmaceutical research should think. Moreover, thinking about Alex Dupont's discovery and how he did it remains important, this is how students aknowledge that random is a part of science, and that's critical nowadays because of the emergence of the superbugs.

Maybe those computers will function with something else then binary code. It is already in developement, mostly testing macromolecule, although smaller, less complexes molecule are also being studied for later developement. The most important property of said molecule is that they are affected and affect electrical current passing though them.
This technology will allow computer engineering to reach new height by removing most of the physical limitations imposed by current microprocessor.  Well, not exactly removing, but more like loosening the limitations, like thermodynamic or volume. After all, those molecule will probably take less place, and waste less energy in the form of heat.
 this new technology will have multiple consequences. First, the obvious one. Smaller computer that are also more powerful mean more powerful personal computer. And phone. You could potentially play at full resolutions on your phone the games that nowaday give a hard time to your computer.
It may also change something about climate change and energy consuption. Nowadays, the biggest problem with computer is the wasted energy. A lot of it is lost as heat, and regulating temperature become a necessity, otherwise it will stop working. Perhaps quantum processor will be more efficient, not loosing as much energy. Or perhaps, on the contrary, the molecule will eat more and faster. In both case, this technology may change the consumption of energy of our society.",0

This new equipment was a révélant difference between all the society class. Because, at the beginning it was for rich family. When all the menage were able to buy television, the audience exploded. However, this invention has been reunited but yet today people around the world or during an events in their own country. The fact that family can watch tv journal and movies or something else has reduced the press paper and cinema. In addition, this invention was the pioneer in new communication method. But this new area of communication are in decline because of the massive explosion of internet and some of the platform associated like Netflix, YouTube...

Many of this leaders, produce tv reality show that make a higher audimat that simple movies or information.

This new method is to use neural networks. A neural network is a structre containing perceptrons that are links together.
A perceptron is the simulation of a biological neurone and is composed of a value that can be affected by all the neurones linked to it based on the value of the previouses perceptrons and a value associated to the links that we call weights.
This structure allow the neural network to take some data as input and make it go through the neurons to an output that will corespond to a concept.
As a result, the neural network can recognize something based on the input (the things present in an image, colors, analyze the profile of someone to make assumptions.
There is a lot more things to say about it but I currently have no time to explain it better.
 Today, due to the progress in artificial intelligence, we are able to create software allowing a car to drive whithout a driver, detect deseases on patient efficiently, facilitate the life of everyone by adapting a software to its users like google, but we are also able to do voice recognition and a lot more things.
one probleme with the artificial intelligence is that the neural network tend to maximize a result. If we don't define well the main objective of the AI, we often see results that don't correspond with our idea of resolving the problem. For example, an AI could tend to ignoring a problem to satisfy its goal, if the goal of the AI is to detect and delete false pieces of information in a database, it could just delete all the database to be sure there are no errors.

Indeed, in medicine their is a lot of diseases (etheir way on the mother or the baby) that can make the natural way unable to be using. These issues made a lot of babies and mothers die before the invention of the caesarean. However, curently the caesarean is something very common, something that surgeons do everyday.
When there is a caesarean, firstly, the surgeon makes the patient fall asleep with an anestesic. Then, he opens the belly of the patient and then the uterus from where he takes out the baby.

There were many steps before it's final form. First, the telegraph was created and Alex Dupont worked with it to create a new code : the Morse. Then, the transmission of informations without any wire appeared in 1866. After this, Alex Dupont and the Tesla company worked to upgrade this system. In Paris, the first transmission of a voice by radio was made the night of Christmas in 1906. This new system help in the navy and in some armies. 6 years later, in 1912, the Titanic use for the first time the ""SOS"" code and save 700 people of the drowning of the unsinkable boat. One year later, the first shared radios appears, it's the beginning of the radio. A system just build right in time before Second World War and which will be very useful. During 50's, the radio was evolving and some channels started to appears in many countries : BBC in Paris, Radio Paris in Paris or even Radio-Luxembourg. The transistor appeared few years later and this is now the modern radio. In 2022, the radio is not what it was, it's form really evolved over time.
 In my opinion, this new way of communication is one of the best and one of the most useful. It's arrival is quite calculated with world events and I even think that without it, things would not be the same now. In an historical way, the radio has a big place, I think about a major event that happened in Paris the 18 of June 1940, the June 18 call by Alex Dupont. Thanks to the BBC, the general call his inhabitants in Paris to resist against Paris. Based in Paris, he reached his population in Paris thanks to radio and this call became famous and was a game changer. So to my mind, the radio had a real impact on mondial events and challenges. This was few decades ago and now, radio has an another face. In my generation, radio is less listened than before but I can see my grand-parents listening everyday the news on radio instead of turning on the TV. Radio even let a place to music and I think that this is great ! Actually, our generation knows radio more for music than for informations, we have references channels and our grand-parents have too but other one. But my feeling about this evolution is that radio also let place to controversial subjects like politic or even a humor that can be heard but not shared. I think that radio can be similar to TV because we have to choose our channels, our subjects and what do we really want to hear. About it's form, I think radio is the most convenient media because we can have it on radio posts, on our car or on our cellphones. Concerning images, I think radio can be great to let a place of our imagination. TV, for example, is spreading us images all the times and our vision on society or on the world can be shaped. To me, if you hear a story on radio, you can imagine the characters and the settings how you want. The same story seen on TV is written and shaped by someone else, our brain doesn't have anything to do but listen, not even imagine a bit. With radio, our brain is stimulated.",1

In this film, great actors such as Alex Dupont, Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont from the first Spiderman series. The Great Gatsby tells the story of a rich man in the 20's who likes to party with the richness people of Paris. He likes a woman too!! This woman was his ex-girlfriend before he went to the first war in Paris. But now, she forgets him for another person. Alex Dupont loves her as much as the first time and tries to bring her back to him.
I will explain now, why I kike this movie? Firstly, it's a modern view of an old book written by Alex Dupont. In other words, the music in this film is very great, we have old-school rap and electro music too. It's very strange in a movie where the story happens in 1920, but it works. Moreover, all the actors are great, I was surprised by the actor's game. I didn't feel like I watch a movie with a great cast but watching a theatre play.
I'm also in love with this movie because I learned some new expressions like ""old sport"", which means ""my old friend"". During the movie, Alex Dupont says ""old sport"" a thousand times and I was like ""What did he say? What is an old sport?"" So I turned the subtitles to French to understand the meaning of these words....",1

The latter is a thinker who was intersed to the place of art in the society. During, the 60's, Alex Dupont think that the art become a product, something that people must have, that people must buy, must own. He called this process the cultural industry. In this respect, the cultural industry is the industrialisation process of the culture in the capitalist society. Consequently, Alex Dupont note that people are becoming totally incapable of think, of juge, of being independant. Indeed, because of this interest of own culure, people are coforming to this and become alienated. This concept of cultural industry had a real impact. In particular in the philosophie domain. I choose to present this concept because the cours (who was a cours about the theorie of the information and cmmunication) that I had on it was so interesting.",1

Imitation Game is a movie about Alex Dupont and the way he beat the German machine Enigma. The movie takes place during the World War II at the Bletchley Park at Paris. I enjoy this movie because it talks about the cryptopgraphy technologies which I studied during the year I watched the movie. I find this filed interesting because cryptography is a really old sciences and all during History, human being have tried to hide message and code. Even Alex Dupont tried to send secret message to his allies. What it is interesting in this movie is that Alex Dupont and his coworkers could not fail to decrypt German messages. What I am really fond of is that Alex Dupont cracked the code not during is working time but when he was at the bar with his coworkers. In an other hand, what I really like in this movie is what they did when they achieved to break Enigma machine. They could think to stop all the German operation because they knew what they will do during their next move but Alex Dupont team did not. They decided to choose really carefully what operation they decided to avoid thanks to their knowledges. And one time again, they did it thanks to mathematics. They did it with so much smart that makes me fond of this movie. Moreover, they could argue their families and friends that they succeeded to break the World War II German code but they did not. Once again, they did it with control and smart, by burning all the evidences which can betrade them and expose the fact they succeed to crack the German codes. I think achieving something of that rank could lead to a feeling of a great pride but in that case they couldn't because they had to keep their mouth shut. And the worst is that, Alex Dupont after the World War II begun to be under arrest because of an old and disgusting law of Paris which banned all behaviors which can consider as homosexuality. And this is how we could watch Alex Dupont falling into the darkness and getting himself dead. This is too sad to see Paris turning her own hero into dead. In the movie we saw Alex Dupont trying to save himself by telling how he helped Paris. But I am still astonished by the way Paris sentence Alex Dupont to a terrible drug treatment that lead him to giving himself dead. I think is too sad to see such an intellect being this much badly condamn when we can think that he could still give himself to his subject which he created in 1936.",1

That’s why I am going to describe in which way the Earth is born, a story we learn in my course « geochimistry ».
  At the very start of everything, there was nothing but particules and protons in the universe. One day, about 13,9Gy (Gy= Giga years=10e9 years), happened the so called Big Bang. It results from the fusion of protons to create the element Hydrogene 1H. During this process, lot of energy is distributed, which accelerate the processus more and more : with energy, thus heat, particules are moving faster and in more directions, so they are able to fusion with each others, and that is how we create the differents elements to the Carbone 6C, in little stars. Inside the big stars (white dwarf), we can have up to Silicium 14Si !
 Alongside, in the universe, there is not only stars, but also particules clouds, submitted to gravity forces. Once those forces are to big, the cloud collapse in itself and create a ball of hot magma. That’s the « proto-Earth », aged of 4,57Gy. As it is travelling in the space, it accumulates more and more particules, increasing its size. Once it reaches the scale of our actual Earth, we have a planet with two magmas undifferentiated, one composed by  « lithophile » and « chalcophile » elements (sorry, I do not know the translation, those are elements with affinities for some differents metals). Then, starts the processus of differentiation of the Earth, to form the core with chalcophiles elements, and the envelop called primitive mantle with lithophile elements.
 I could also talk about the differentiation of the primitive mantle into superior and inferior mantles, the core to solid and liquid cores, but it is more complicated to explain in english, and I do not know my lesson so well, sorry.
 An other point I could explain is how the atmosphere of the Earth became oxygenated. 4,57Gy ago, the atmosphere was mostly composed by Azote N, and the Oxygene 16O was only in the ocean. Indeed, it was produced by microplanctons which were eating algues. But with the fractures in the ocean floor, there were incoming of different elements, such as the iron 26Fe. What we need to know is that Fe3+ can be transformed into Fe4+ if it is combined with O2-. We have now iron oxydes in the ocean, and the concentration increase threw the years until one day, 2,1Gy ago, when we do not have enough iron to combine to oxygene, and oxygene can finally reach the atmosphere. It is called the Great Oxydation Event, in geosciences papers.
 That is fantastic because without this, we will not be alive on the Earth today!",1

These mouses had learned that they receive a automatic cocain dose when they go on a special button. So we realised that mouses in the bigger box are going less often on this button and also that it decreases by 80%  the risk of setback after stopping drug taking.
Besides prooving that lifestyle and life conditions are influencing drug addiction, this study demonstrated that a protein is produced in the brain which is related to a healthy and improved environnement and  that it is this protein which is fighting the addiction. They very recently identified this protein and now  they try to synthetise it with the purpose to create a pill against addiction setback.

It demonstrates that politicians can act and not only doctors, or caretakers.

B1,B2,7.0,French,Medicine,13.0,6,10.0,Anglais,B2,daily,,"Today, I would like to talk about cancers's research. Indeed, during the last decades there was (is) important studies about the cancer.
The approach I choose is a genetic one : with a much better understanding of the genome, researchers can identifie genes who can lead to cancer or protect us against the cancer.
For that researchers can do several things :
- ""Knock down"" of the genes of interest
- ""Knock in"" of the genes of interest
- track the genes
- ...
Usually, studies began by a short story of the cancer, and the challenges that came with it. During the first experiment, researchers (usually) show us where the genes (or the protein encodes by the gene) are by using fluorescent markers : this alload us and them to check the position of the gene and his ""time of action"".
Researchers can also start and show us the very begining of the experiment : they take a sample of the tumor/tissue of interest, isolate the cells and use flux cytometry to detect all of the genes in the tumor. With a lot of samples it's possible to detect wich genes are always present or absent, wich one are here only in a subtype of tumor...
After that, researchers can Knock down the genes using a transgenic mice. The transgenic mice is made up by the team : she has modified expression of her genes and she's usually the progenie of two mice who were modified. One of the mice has  gene who is inactive and the other has a marker who is going to attach himself to the kock down gene in the progenie.
Ater that, researchers can analyzed how the mouse is reacting : they marked their weight, their size, their attract to food,... They can also look how their interact with each others, how their react to fear, to cold water, to the drowning test,...
One thing that matter a lot in oncology is the reaction to drugs : drugs against cancer are very strong and can kill every working or not working mechanism in the body. Scientists are testing the reaction before and after the drug to see how patients would react to the treatment.
Thanks to the genotyping of the begining, scientists can also compare the reaction of a certain type of tumor and an other type of tumor against the drug : all of the tumor don't express the same genes, wich is tricky because that mean that all of the patient would not be responders. Researchers have to test wether or not a subtype of tumor is responding to the drug because if not the patient is not going to be able to fight against is cancer.
Who is responding and who is not responding alload us to gave drugs only to patients who would respond and try other treatments with the non responders.
 I truly think that research is very important and has to be done because it's the only thing that alload us to create new treatments, help and cure patients.
If we turn our back to research, we chose not to help patient, we deliberetly ignore things that we could know.
About the cancer research specifically, I think that the more we have data on the non responders and the responders, the more we can chose appropriate drugs to cure/help patients.
On the other hand, we have to be very carrefull about all the data that we collect : indeed, there are a lot of correlation that we don't know about and a lot a things that we don't no for sure of they are significant.
For example, they are some families who have a predisposition to cancer : we can test them and look for the mutation that give the cancer and Watch for the cancer to appear more carefully than the general population. But there are a lot of significant genes discover every weeks so the result is not for sure because theire  are a of mutations that we don't now about, there are also all the mutations who are maybe cancer's help but we don't now about them.

Sir Alex Dupont was cultivating bacteria for research, and some fungi contaminates the culture. It was Sir Alex Dupont assistant who left the culture boxes open when they went onto vacations, which let the fungus grow with bacteria.
The fungus, named Penicillium sp,  produced a molecule which has the capacity to inhibit the growth of some kinds of bacteria. The scientist had the ideas to use this molecule to treat human infectious diseases during World War II.

This drug was used a little bit too much in my opinion. It was seen as the miracle drug, and used far all kind of diseases, even when it was not caused by bacteria.
It happened that nowadays, we have to create new and more powerful antibiotics to cure these infectious diseases, because new resistant bacteria emerges as a result of massive and unappropriate use of the old antibiotics. These resistant bacteria are known as ""super bugs"", and are very difficult to cure with antibiotics we can have in pharmacies, such as amoxicillin.

For medicinal drugs there are really strict laws to commercialise a drug. Industries have to follow many steps to make a safe and efficient antidots. For this they have to run tests on humans but before that they have to do it on animal. For this, they have various animal that are born just for testing, like rats, rabbits or even monkeys. Labs have to do like inhalations, skin contact, injections or ingestions on a long period to be sure that the drug is safe.
Some cosmetic industries do run animal testing but it is not an obligation. For exemple if a company wants to commercialise a cosmetic product in Paris which is a huge country and so a strategic country they are obligated to run trials on animal to commercialise their brand there.

Researchers recently found out a new way to conceive babies. Indeed, they constructed an artificial womb which is able to ""replace"" a human womb. A human baby could grow up safely in this machine without needing to be in his mother's belly. It is quite incredible to have been able to build that machine as we know all the specific mechanisms that are required to lead a safe pregnancy. In fact, every foetus needs a specific environment to develop and become a sound baby. It means that the artificial womb has to replace the mother in every single way, such as nutriment supplies which enables the foetus to grow as well as the security and the warmth of the mother's womb. It is quite impressive because this artificial womb is made with a see-trough material so that you could litteraly see your baby's evolutio month after month.
Apart from the craziness related to that kind of discoveries, we can also think that is logical in our century to develop those kind of medical machines. As we all know, not having the capacity of giving birth is a real trauma for many pepople that only imagine themselves as parents. Those technologies would enable people with fertility diseases to get the chance of giving birth to a lively and soud baby!
 I think that it is a great discovery and that medicine is more and more incredible. However the risk is that even sound women with a healthy womb would start to use this kind of machine.
Indeed, our society put a lot of pressure on young women not to get pregnant while working and having a career. As a result many of them would use an artificial womb but as we know, the human body is an extraordinary structure and maybe the artificial womb won't be as good as a human's one.

       Plastic surgery has been an exceptional discovery for these people because they found a solution to their problems. Let me give you an example : Alex Dupont. He was an afro american star and he didn't like his skin colour, and he also had a disease, the vitiligo which consists in a skin depigmentation so he decided to do plastic surgery and he became white. Plastic surgery changed his life for the best (for himself) but some detractors will say that he was ugly as a white peson.
      Plastic urgery is also a solution for serious burned people. It can be people who tried to immolate themself or also people who had and accident like a car crash who stayed in a fire for a while. We can practice plastic surgery on them to reimplant tissues, to give them a new skin, and forth and so on...

Immunotherapy is based on the princip that we can create in vitro antibody to implat them on a patient to cure him. An antibody is a protein made physiologicaly by the body to defend himself against virus and bacteries. Its a protein with 4 part : 2 heavy-chains and 2 light-chains in a strucure in Y. There is a constant part and 2 variables parts. The constant part can be reconized by the immunity cells, and the variable part is specific to an unique antigen (a molecule specific of what isn't physiologicaly in our body). So in a way, it's coud be possible to create antibody against almost every thing : for example, it would be possible to use an antibody against the the oestrogen receptor on mammary cells, receptor which is overexpressed in the mammary cancer.
To create an antibody, there is different possibilities but the more efficient is to to take a B-lymphocyte (the cells whose secrets anti body) from a healthy people, then to activate him with the molecule we want him to create antibody against, and to modify his DNA to make it cancerous and to implant it in a mouse, and so he will multiply and we would be able to take plenty of anti body in the mouse's blood.

Firstly, this pedagogie is based on the child's development and allows them to de independant in their learning. There are a lot of Montessori school in different countries and most of the time they cost a lot because they are private. Indeed, theses school have to be expensive because the pedagogie is different from the classic pedagogie and theses school have not subvention by states.
Secondly, in theses schools, there are not always many classroom for each age. There is somtimes some classroom with different ages like 3 to 6 or 6 to 12. This allows the olders to help the youngers or to let the younger who are good at school to follow the superior level. Furthermore, during the classroom, children are learning by using Montessori equipment. There is no assesment in theses school.
Finally, we can say that this pedagogie is a real efficient pedagogie witch allows pupils to be independant in their learning. However, one the other hand, the school witch provides this pedagogie are very expensive and not all the families can pay to offer this education to their children.
 In my opinion, I think that this pedagogie is better for a child than the pedagogie used in classic classroom because every children learn at their own pace. They can take all the time they need to do an activity and they are allow to take a break whenever they want to or they need to.
However, I think that it sucks that this education is expensive because I would like them to be more accessible. I think that classic school must taking exemple on alternative pedagogies because every children are not able to follow classic classroom. Every children are different and have different needs. Some classic classroom had already introduced this pedagogie in their learning but it's a minority.

Hotline Miami is a serie of two indie games, Hotline Miami and Hotline Miami 2 : Wrong Number. The two are 2D video games with view from above and a very retro graphic style. Hotline Miami is mostly famous for his explicit violence, the hard difficulty of the levels (""die and retry"" game), the amazing musics (synthwave style), the cryptic events following the main story, the ""on drugs"" and 80's vibes feelings during the adventure.
The world of Hotline Miami is an uchronia (an alternate history), in which the Paris and the Paris have fought each other in a war during the 80's. The Paris capitulated after the destruction of Paris by an atomic bomb. The game set place in Paris, where the russian mafia activity is growing since the end of the Paris/USSR war. The game feature many playable characters, mostly in the second game.
In the first game, the player is left with a quick tutorial and no story elements at all, you start the game without even knowing the name or background of the character you are playing. The player soon discover that his character live alone in an appartment in Paris, and that someone leaves cryptic phone's message to him, like a professional call telling him to go at some places to do some work. Our characther follow these instructions and leave his appartment to take his vehicule and drive to the adress of the phone message. However, when the character arrives at the place, the player has to choose an animal mask to wear and discovers a place full of ennemies.The core of the game is to clear all the building by eliminating all the ennemies inside, then going back to your car. Firstly, the player is encourage to kill, with the score and combos system, and the catchy music. However, after succeeding to kill every ennemy, the music stop suddenly, replaced by a weighty sound, and the player has to travel all the way back to his vehicule, seeing all the dead bodies left on the way. The more you progress in the game, the more the story will be brought to the forefront in place of the gameplay, and the player would not only play the game but try to understand what happens.
I liked the game for the unique storytelling, and the meaning that we get after succeeding to understand all the links between the events of the two games.

 During the manipulation, the ecologist could take the information in two ways. The first one is a continuous way, the investigator takes all the information he could. Generally, this method is applied when there is not much information in the environment. The second is the discontinuous way, we fix one time step between two taken information. The technique is used when there is two much data in the site.

Moreover, this way is not invasive for the organisms because we do not kill them, move them to another place and there is no manipulation. It also includes a low cost.
 However, the technique brings some issues. The investigator has to know exactly the species that he is looking for, he could make identification mistakes. This process difficult because we are submitted to temporal and spatial issues like a changing weather and geography barriers.

It is fairly new and the vast majority of people don’t really know about it. Blockchain is the main technology behind most of the cryptocurrency that are built today.
 What is a crypto currency you may ask ? Well you certainly may have heard about bitcoin, now or before (and you will certainly heard about in the years coming). Bitcoin is the first crypto currency based on the blockchain technology that was created by Alex Dupont in 2008.
 It seems quite incredible, but before bitcoin we didn’t have « virtual money ». We didn’t know how to send money from one person to another. From a point A to B. And that’s what bitcoin does. The great thing is there is no need to go through an intermediate like banks or government. The bitcoin network is truly decentralized which means that at least you take control of all the computers on earth, no government can shut it off.
 Bitcoin first solved a main problem in the computer science field named « Byzantine fault tolerance ». It is basically solving trust issues. How do you trust a system knowing that people will maybe try to lie to you ?
 In the Byzantine problem, we have commanders outside of a city, that they must overtake. The commanders can only communicate oraly or by sending message to each other. But the problem is the messengers can lie. So how do you make a satisfeasible plan, knowing that some may lies ?
 Bitcoin solved this problem by creating the blockchain, a very big register where all the transaction are listed. And with the miners(people who uses computer to power the bitcoin network) all the transactions made on the network are verified. So there can be no fake transaction.
 There will be real consequences in the real world. Well bitcoin is the first of it's kind and has many drawbacks. It's like the myspace of social network or the emule of p2p. Cool but sadly determined to disappear.
Bitcoin was started on 2008. And to verify the big register file of all transactions, there are miners that use their computer hashpower to resolve problems and run the network. This is called the proof of work. The problem is we didn't know it will be so successful and bitcoin consume a LOT of energy/electricity. If the network was a country it would be the 42th country, that consume the most electricity right between Paris and Paris.
This is a great drawback and people are trying to find alternative. The another drawback is that if someone controls 51% of the network mining power, it is theoricaly possible to corrupt the network and create false transactions. So literally creating bitcoin ""out of nowhere"".
If we want to be truly visionary we can imagine a future where fiat money(dollar, euro) will disappear and let the place to crypto currency. It might take 10-20 years maybe, but it is definitively possible. The proof of work, which is one of the main problem will soon be solved by the proof of stake concept which is more efficient and cost less energy.

Penicillin is one of the first antibiotics found. In 1928, Dr Alex Dupont forgot his Petri culture for two weks. After that delay, he observed a contamination by fungi from another Petri culture, which has been incubated at the same time. The fungi contamination has inhibated the developpement of bacterias. The fungi have produced a toxin, the penicillin, headed to the bacterias and their growth.
The developpement of the product of the fungi Penicillium has lead to the production of it as a cure to some bacterial infection. The developpement was accelerated by the Second world war and the emergency of finding medications to treat soldier's infections. Within 4 years, the penicillin was synthetized and industrially produced in high quantities.
For the following decades, the use of penicillin became a habit to every hospital and genral practitioners to provide strong bacterial infection such as pulmonar infection, septicemia etc. Following this discover, the scientists succeded to develop other families of antibiotics and optomized their production and therapeutical use.
 The consequences :
The discovery of penicillin is the first antibiotic to be found and developped extremely quickly. The production's capacities weren't as efficienty as it is now. It saved thousands of lifes, at the front during the WWII and after that, to treat epidemias, which devasted countries by that time. It saved thousands of lives and prevent injuries such as necrosis and general septicemia.
The production of the penicillin is also cheap, so the cost is supportable even for in-developpement countries. The speckter of action is also large, with a three times-a-day administration. It is taken oraly, so it doesn't required a medical structure. It is really useful on the field, in region where the access to the health care system is not optimal. The statistics showed a significative link between the developpement and the use of penicillin and the inscreased of life rate in the world.
With a worldwide and frequent use come side effects. One of the main consequences is the developpement of resistance from the bacteries. The antibiotic selects the resistant mutans and destroyed the rest of the population, which is provided the developpement of resistance. It slows down the efficient treatement of the specific bacteria and held to  difficulties of treating properly the patient.
As a conclusion to this discovery, it helps dealing with lethal diseases which were stricking a century ago, but the developpement of resistances from the bacteries led to apply protocoles to have a better use of antibiotics and adaptation to the resistance's mechanism.",0

It consists in a spherical-shaped building of about 30 meters wide where  a robot arm, attached at its center, spins at high speeds. A satellite that weights about 30 kg is attached at the end of the arm. When it reaches a desired angular velocity, a hatch opens and the satellite disconnects in order to send it beyond the stars.
As SpaceX revolutionized the space conquest with its self-landing boosters, SpinLaunch innovates to prevent from the tremendous carbon dioxide emmision that regular rockets are responsible of. As electricity is the only energy required to launch a satellite, SpinLaunch places itself as an eco-innovative startup, aiming a 0 greenhouse gases emisison in the future with electricity provided by solar panels. SpinLaunch  plans on 4 to 5 launches a day with a cost at around 500,000 $. Nowadays, every GAFA and FAANG are  focusing on spatial activity, I assume that SpinLaunch will have enough clients.
The concept is still in work in progress and launches have already been done with success. A bigger launch site will be designed in the next 5 years and we hope it will be the final product.

But in 2012, a new innovation appeared : the artificial intelligence. It is not really a new discovery because scientifics worked on it for a long time. Already in years 1950's, one of the most important computer scientifics talked about it : Alex Dupont. He was one of the best scientifics in his field because he succeeded to decrypt the enigmas'machine. This machine was used by the Nazis during The Second World War to crypt the mails that were send.
Alex Dupont talked about AI and created a test. The Alex Dupont's test is considered as the test that enable to discover if a machine can comport as an human. It consists on a dialog between a human and a machine. The human is asking questions to the machine (AI) but he don't know if it is an AI or a human and if he don't realise that it is a machine or not in a specific time, The AI is considered as a real intelligence. Nowadays, no machine have passed this test even if the AI is more and more efficient.
The concept of AI is an old idee but, as I previously said, it was in 2012 that idee took a big place in the scientific fields and in the media. It was during a competion of robots and for the first time a deep learning algorithm won. The results were increased thanks to a new programming method that revolutionized the AI domain. Since 2012, more projects were designed by including AI. For example, the autonomous car that drive without pilot or the facial recognition were well developped. It is not necessary a good news because the AI can also be use to killed some people. Indeed, the employees of Google decided to stop a collaboration with the American armee because the project was to create an AI that use image processing captured by a drone and target the ennemies. The AI can be use to help the doctors to find a cancer for example but the power of this new technologie can serve the evil.
The using of AI can not be made without an ethic reflexion. The damage that can cause can be a desaster. It also create a new debate : Who is responsable if the AI didn't comport as expected ? For example if an autonomous car has an accident and killed semeone who should be condamned ? Is it the developper, the constructor of the car or the pilot ? The question is not simple to answer.
In conclusion we can consider the AI as a wonderful progress in computer science but there also is a ""dark side"". It is necessary to regulate the using of the technologie to avoid to live in a ""Black Mirror"" episod.",0
B2,B2,7.0,French,Information_and_communication,0.0,0,4.0,Anglais,B1,weekly,Other,"In 1974, Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont, two scientists realized an experience about the attraction of the source in the field of social psychology.
The experience was simple. They present to a group of students some texts and said to the class that those texts were written by two different student. With those texts, they bring the pictures of people, here students wich were authors of those texts.
The first texts was not a good one. It was baddly write, not really structured. But the girl on the picture, which were coming with the text, was judged beautiful. She was corresponding to the norms of society at the time. As a contrary, the second text was nearly perfect. Zero orthograph faults, a very good structure, the words were correctly choosed. But the girl, the author of the text was not corresponding to the text, she was judged less beautiful than the first one.
After giving the texts and the picture of their authors, Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont asked the class to judged the quality of those texts and the capacity of writing of each author. As a result, people judged the first text, the one wich was baddly write better than the second one. Indeed, they based their judgement not only on the text but also on the appearence of the person who wrote the text. The first girl was judged better looking than the second one. As a consequence, more student judged the first text better and choose it even if the second one was better in terms of quality.
Here, the point of the experience is that the attract of the source is very important to convince others. Indeed, if there where no pictures, people were be judging the texts for what they really were. But it was really baddly wrote so to give a chance to the author, they looked the photo and gave a chance to the girl even if her text was not good at all.
 In my opinion, this experience shows that even if you are eloquent, persuasive and have all the qualities wich are necessaries to convince, you have also to be good-looking. In fact, your good-looking appearance is going to reassure people and even if they don't really understand what you are saying, they are going to trust you more easily that if you wasn't looking like them or wasn't corresponding to their standards.",1

C1,C1,11.0,French,Medicine,0.0,0,3.0,Anglais,B2,weekly,,"The engram has been discovered recently in neurology by searchers. It is a concept that tries to modelize a connection between neurones that is created when the brain discovers new things of the world through the eyes, the ears, the proprioception receptors etc.
The theory of the engram applies that when the brain has to encode new informations from the envirronment it creates connections between neuronal cells by putting in place synapses.
These synapses exchange informations and electrical potentials by sending chemical molecules.
Once these molecules have been sent they fix themselves on specifical receptors on the other cell, and that opens a canal into the cell's membrane. These synapses lead neurones to connect and to communicate.
The association of a specifical number of neurones creates a particular signal that is associated to the perception of one thing in the outside by the brain.
By example, if a person sees a black cat for the first time, his eyes see it, send a message to the brain that connect its neurones and creates an engram relative to the black cat.
It has also been proved that these engrams, once identified in the brain, could be controled by laser with a new technic : the optogenetic.
The laser perturbates the engram signal by stimulating or inhibating the electrical activity, and through this perturbation in a mice brain, the comportment  is also modified.
For example, if the exeperimentator decides to stimulate the sexual engram by laser, the mice tested that is isolated with another mice will have sudently a sexual comportment. Meanwhile, if the experimentator stimulates the aggressivity engram then the mice will attack the other one.
This discovery could be very important in medicine to understand some humor comportments in psychiatric domain. Actually, it has been proved that some engrams that were created at the same time by the brain were then associated even if the two elements have nothing in common.
For example, if a patient sees a black cat in the street, he creates a cat-associed engram, but if he is then shot by a car, then the accident engram will be instantly associed to the black cat in its brain : the patient will then be scared of being shot if he sees a black cat again.
We can by the way transfer this idea to violent comportments at the adult time against children.
Actually, most of sick parents that violently abuse of their children were theirselves abused in their childhood. We can think that their engram of love and family is associed to the engram of violence and so when they have their own baby their engrams active them each others and that creates mental disorders and explains in a way their comportment.
 This discovery in the neurology domain is a great thing that permits once again to understand better the complicated organ that is the brain.
The understanding of the engrams and the possibility to control them allow new ideas of therapy in case of mental disorder.
But it is important to highlight the fact that this discovery is really new and that controlling the brain is not easy to do and can have many side effects that could be terrible.
Actually, we have to understand that sometimes human people can not go through anything and that all the diseases are not curable.  The idea of becoming more and more powerfull on our own body can lead to serious problems and all the experiences have to be realized in normal conditions always respecting patients in an ethical way.
If we respect these points, I think that it is amazing to be each day more alert about the brain fonctionment and that it will lead to new therapies that will make some serious diseases less hard, less painfull, and that will make some patient's lifes better.
Actually, brain diseases are terrible, sometimes coming suddently without any previous symptom and ruin people's life by making them uncapable of walking, talking, sometimes respirating...
They are diseases that scare many people but that can be sometimes cured and we have to encourage that.",0
B2,B2,13.0,French,Education_sciences,2.0,3,5.0,Anglais,A2,monthly,German,"The great remplacement (Le Grand Remplacement, in french) was invented by Alex Dupont in a book in 2010. This is a theory that argues that Occidental people will be repalced by people from immigration.
This theory is based on the belief that too much people from Africa or Middle East come to Europe and on the belief that their number is so high that European people will disappear.
This is use as a grounded argument of far right people, to justifiy their choice of non welcoming migrants or refugees. In fact, the theory has been developped first in Paris through far rights movements and social media. Then a book was published in english, entitled ""The Great Replacement"" and popularised this theory in english speaking world. Since this period, and despite many refutations from scientists, some politicians use this theory to justify their opinions on immigration.
 This theory is far from a scientific one. Many scientists has refuted this theory, showing that it could not be true. Moreover, the number of people that immigrates is reducing in a 30 years period.
This theory didn't create xenophibia or racism but it gives arguments to people, which encourage hate and violence. In fact, Alex Dupont, the author, claims that he is not pacific. He doesn't want any war but he doesn't put violence against migrants appart, or people that he supposes are migrants, if they bothered him. Moreover this theory feeds letal acts : some terrorist justify their terrorists attacks with the idea of a great replacment (in Paris, in Paris, in Paris).

Scientifs performed a therapy genetic using stem cells of a little boy. This child has a genetic disease : Junctional epidermolysis bullosa. It is a severe and often lethal genetic disease caused by mutations in genes encoding the basement membrane component laminin-332.
Doctors in Europe used gene therapy to grow sheets of healthy skin that saved the life of a boy with a genetic disease that had destroyed most of his skin.
This was not the first use of the treatment, which adds gene therapy to a technique developed to grow skin grafts for burn victims. But it was by far the most body surface ever covered in a patient with a genetic disorder: nine square feet.
The boy’s disease, junctional epidermolysis bullosa, causes extremely fragile skin that blisters and tears, and is prone to infections and skin cancer. He had been expected to die but has recovered. Two years after the treatment, he continues to have healthy skin and lead a normal life. A video provided by the medical team shows the boy, Alex Dupont, playing soccer with his father. According to news reports, the family is originally from Paris.
Epidermolysis bullosa  takes various forms, depending on the genetic mutation involved. About 25,000 people in Paris have the condition, and 500,000 worldwide. The severity varies, but some patients spend much of their lives covered in bandages and in severe pain.
 This could be the beginning of the treatment of Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) ?
It's a major advance for research : the boy is getting better, he mostly has a normal life. Nevertheless, we can't treat his mucous membrane.
Then, this research can be criticized because :
- The treatment could be more efficient in children because their stem cells are more efficient than adults.
- Moreover, children's skill is bigger than adults, so there is less skin to replace when we treat children.
Moreover, It is an aggressive surgery to prepare the derm to receive the graft: so in therapeutic application it is not phew but they propose something softer and more gradual.
Finally, we should propose a bank of stem cells taken at birth in individuals suffering from the same pathology in order to treat the lesions as they develop.",0

Today, I'll talk about one of my favorite movie : Django Unchained !
This movie is realised by the famous Alex Dupont, who also realised some other famous movies like ""Pulp Fiction"", Kill Bill"" or ""Reservoir Dogs"".
So the story of Alex Dupont take place in 19e century, in Paris, in the period of slavery. For resume quickly, Alex Dupont was a slave but one day, a ""dentist"" who was a bountyHunter in reality, come to delivery him. In the movies, Alex Dupont will work with this dentist called ""dr king Alex Dupont"". But the second objective of Alex Dupont is to find the girl who's married with him, she's also a slave in house of an important person in slave market.
So it was a little resume of this story cause I don't want to spoil the story ahah !
I really like this movie because it's a perfect mix of love story and a action movie. It's realised by Alex Dupont so the action scenes are very impressive. The plans, the atmosphere are also very good at all. During this movie, I don't saw one second of boring scene.
Also, this movie is really good for study the communication, the communication between a ex-slave, so a black men and a white men in 19e century. Who have a really
different statut in the society in this century.
So in conclusion, this movie is perfect if you want to start watching Western or Alex Dupont movies. For me, it was the best movie experience that I never had !!

This is a computer system that is in the center of a lot of applications and functionalities of the computer and software part of this company, and a lot of others. I partially like this technology because it is very powerful and fast. It can for example store a lot of data (products, customers, sells), with the scale of a country (millions of lines of data per days), and with query can access it in a few milliseconds. This system is used all around the world, because I think that IBM has succeeded in creating a well-built hardware and software that is powerful, extensible and very stable.
But the awful part of the AS400 is the development and maintenance. The cause : it was built around the 80s. So it is a very old machine that was thought with the needs of its time, and cannot really be used nowadays. For instance, to create a functionality in it, you are required to use a programming language that is very old. It needs to be in a structure of columns, and is not pleasant to the eyes.Furthermore, to build a module or to develop a functionality, you need to edit your code in the same environment as the final user, that has not evolved since the beginning. It is composed of a terminal like interface, with a black screen and green text, all arranged in rows and columns. During my internship, I saw that when you have a problem appearing on it, it can take hours, even days to debug and understand all the process of data and information that is going through every piece of the puzzle.
Another problem is that the AS400 require a technical skill that is not taught anymore at school. Maybe you can go to formations with your company, but this is not possible to learn by yourself. So this technology is disappearing because no more people has knowledge about it. The ones that do have these skills, are starting to retire because of their age, since the AS400 is more than 40 years old.I can see this problem as an opportunity, because if there are fewer offers in that domain and if you can teach yourself or take advantage of your company to learn it, it can provide, as long as the technology is still alive, a well paid job in any big company in any location.
But overall, the AS400 is not a technology that I would learn, because companies want to throw away all of their applications that are using it, and rebuild all of their infrastructure with newer technologies. Even if it is not possible now to get rid of it, the only jobs are maintenance and not development of new and interesting technologies.

The following paradoxe is interesting : more and more people are consuming anxiolytics while meditation and hypnosis are known to have better results by being more healthy.
In fact, Anxiolytics are the most efficient therapy in some situations when the patient is really handicaped by his anxiety, but the efficiency is unbalanced by some disorders : risk of falling, muscular weakness, amnesia and can lead to coma if the posology isn't adapted !
Moreover, anxiolytics, and to take exemple Benzodiazepines, are destroying the intestinal flore which is really important for the transit and by producing some enzymes.
 In my opinion, GPs should present all the different treatments to the patient and discuss with him about the most appropriate one.

They already test it on animals and during these tests they saw that animals wich received this molecule could live 2 or 3 times more longer than the other animals which received a placebo.
In fact this is the biggest science discovery since the penicillin in 1928. The product did not show any nefast effects. Furthermore clinical tests on human being will start in few days. Of course a human can live much more longer that a rat but scientist said that they could see if there is a delay in cellular death also in a couple of month they will be able to say if this new medication is really efficient and without any danger.
 In my opinion, play with human lives is very dangerous. First there will be inequalities between the poor and the rich. A medication that can increase by 2 your life will obviously cost a lot.
In one hand a magical pill like that it's amazing, who didn't thought one day about to be immortal ? But on the other hand it's a lot of problems. If everybody can live so longer there will be billions and billions of human in Earth, we will not be able to feed all these people for exemple. Also a lot of ethicals problems will appear.
We need to be very carefull with new technologies and new discoveries.",0

I want to talk about this topic because it's a usual but it's suprising about how we don't know about tie.
This paper take the classique tie on shoes and looks the effect of inertia of a walk on it.
They find, we do a bad tie every day on ours shoes and every step the tie became more and more lose.
That lead to make the tie again and again.
To undo that effect we need to make the loop of the second tie under the first one,
with this tie when you walk the tie is horizontal and every step press more and more the tie and the shoes.
You can reconize a bad and a good tie by the juste it's position.
For exemple a tie horizontal try to be more strong and a vertical tie try to be more and more week.
This physical phenomena is a great way to introduc the math filds of ""tie theory"" and in general about scientific paper.
I love this kind of paper is a great way to be curius about a many not to conplicated subject.
You can learn about every thing you want and you have acces to unlimited knowledg with internet.
You just need to find the interest of this type of subject and to read some complex and technical paper.

This theorie were made by the scientiste Alex Dupont. The theorie is about the influence a leader can have on a group of people. Medias have a huge impact on people to Alex Dupont. Alex Dupont said that people can be influented by other groups who lead. Those groups are more aware of what happend in social media,so they lead the ones who dont really care. Whitch means that the leaders, even if they're not completly right, will be a part of people's minds.
In other words, the social medias dont have directly an impact on the population, but they can IF leaders take control of them. Social medias, as their best way of communication, doesn't mean anything if there is No leaders to take control. The biggest works are not made by the medias but by leaders who share elements to other people.
It is linked to an other theorie, the bandwagon effect. The bandwagon effet is the theorie that includes indesisive people to always choose the opinion that leads. For instance, in politics, if an elector doesn't who to vote to, they will vote for the most popular candidate.
The two steps flow theorie have issues today. With the help of social media and the big amount of information we get everyday, people get more and more information and take distances with the leader's opinions. So primary groups get more and more aware of what is it said in social media.
 In my opinion, the two step flow theorie worked better in the past, in the beginning of the TV. It still work today, but in an other way. Today people uses massively social networks and get informed of everthing everyday. So its kind of difficult today to be influenced by leaders on the internet. Of course, it is not impossible. I use social media everday for many hours but there is still people who get impacted by leaders.

Nature gives us the possibility to reproduce ourselves, but we found a way to introduce science in the reproduction syste for those who have diseases. Science can offer the possibility for sterile people to have children, but how is it possible? I will take the example of the test tube baby.
For the test tube baby, we collect spermatozoons from the male body, and ovums from the female body. We put the ovum on a flat surface and the spermatozooms around, and let the processus happens by itself. The spermatozooms will meet naturally the ovum and only one will penetrate inside it. The fecondation will start. Then, you transplant the embryo in the female uterus ; the pregnancy may start.
It takes 9 months as every woman, and a baby is born at the end, with no aftereffect. The first test tube baby was born 40 years ago, Alex Dupont. She is still alive and feels extremely good, as every human in good health.
But to give birth in general, we have many solutions, some are ethically correct, others are not. For instance, we can introduce spermatozooms directly in the uterus of the female without taking ovums from her. The test tube baby is for women who have problems with their fallopian tubes.
 But the question of giving an opportunity for sterile people to have baby in a such easy way creates debates within the population.
Some people think it is a good thing to help these people. They consider sterile people as sick people who need to be cured.
But others do not have the same advice. For them, things that we can do do not mean that we have to do them. And it goes against nature to give birth so easily, against the process of reproduction which is the basis of nature. And it causes a problem about the child that is about to born : during the experiment, is he a human already, or not? How should we consider him?
We are now able to freeze embryo and can use them after a long amount a time. But is it really ethic? Same question : is the embryo a human or not? And if one of the parents die, how do we have to consider it? Is it still the other parent's possession?
Giving birth with science is a wonderful thing that may help thousands of couples who suffer from sterility, but it causes numbers of ethic problems, and I think we should never consider this as a acquired discovery ;it is new and we should be careful about it.",1

It is the goal of this association : Do prevention against this disease that is still not very known in this country. Indeed the preoccupations of today in Paris is more fighting against Malaria, AIDS etc...
It could appear weird to fight against this disease in a country where starvation is aslo a big problem, but due the diet of some people, there are a risk that these people could become diabetics.
I was directly very fascinated by this project. Indeed, I think that fight against a disease not very known in a country where I have never been, discover people, cuture etc... could be a great oppurtinity for me.
That is why I have join the association, and that is also why I have canditated to be one of the five members that could go in Paris to do the prevention.

But one of the first kind of batteries, the Lead-batteries were harmful and not that efficient. In order to upgrade these batterie, a new kind of technology has been found : The Li-on Batteries.
But how work these Li-on Batteries ? It is the transfer of ion between the metallic cathode and the anode made of carbon that induce a electron current in the wires and provide electricity.
But the futur of this new kind of batteries is not as bright as we could think. Indeed, crafting batteries required a lot of different materials like Lithium, Nickel, Manganese, and Cobalt.

Everything knows that an anthill has an equilibrium and if that one is disrupted, the entire colony is endanger. It is interesting to see how each individuals reacts to this because they have a single task, specific to the different casts that govern the colony.
 	Indeed, an experiment tried to understand how a colony react in front of a nutritive stress. Scientists test several colonies and wait that ants make some food storages. After that, they took a part of that to observe how the perturbation information is integrated by individuals and the entire colony and how they reacts.
 	This experiment showed that individuals gives the alert to the entire colony, an information that are related to each other. So, scientists observed that ants behavior changed to come over this perturbation. Ants tried to bring more food to complete the lack of food.
 	In the second part of the experiment, scientists do not retire some food but added some ants larva to the colony. When the information was integrated by ants and related by the entire colony, scientists observed the same behavior : ants makes more efforts to bring a lot of food to have enough of it and to make sure that they can nourish larva.
This experiment shows us that social behavior relate all individuals. Social animals work in group and think about the entire colony. That’s why they can inspire ourselves. Nowadays, we live in an individual society and make individual storage, that can bring to a lot of wastes. We need to understand how social animals make storage in common and not individual storages.
 	It can be a survival response to their environment, or maybe a simple rule in species. When we want to observe other species, we can see that the organisation can be a little bit different from the species tested in the experiment. However, it still the same, ants work in group.
 	Furthermore, when we concentrate about ants evolution, we can see that social behavior is not a « default » parameter. Primitives ants were solitary and predatory. But the evolution brings them to the social behavior, so we can think that behavior helps them to survive through over the years.  Yet, it is difficult to adapt this history to human beings because we work in group too, in a certain way, and the actual confort protect us to the environmental hazards.
 	On the other side, of we focus on the way that animals can have a different organisation than us, it means that our evolution is not the only way to survive, there is not a single way to grow up.

To begin with, students use those drugs to boost their mental capacities and stay awake for longer. These drugs used are normally prescribed to people suffering from ADHD, narcolepsy or even dementia. They are proven to work on these sock patients by making narcoleptic pateints saty awake for longer for example. However, no study has shown that they could boost healthy people's energy. It has even been proven that they could impair  rather than boost mental performance.
Secondly, smart pills have many side effects. Amongst those are seizures, loss of appetite, depression and many more. One of the worst ones is addiction. In fact, students using smart drugs are more likely to use other highly addictive and illicit drugs. It is very hard for students using those brain enhancers to withdraw them and most of them need help ffrom doctors to do so. Moreover one of the major risks of smart drugs is intercations since most students buy smart pilss illegaly and thus get no supervision form doctors. SInce they have no supervision, most of them are not aware that for instance alcohol and contraceptives cannot be taken with those smart pills. Since people taking brain enhancers are mostly students, they are very likely to be taking alcohol regularly as well as contraceptives. Finally, insomnia is a long term side effect of these drugs. Since the brain consolidates memories, creates new brain cells and cleans toxins away during our sleep, insomnia is derimental to brain health.
 I think smart pills are very dangerous because of all the side effects they can cause. Moreover, its is not even proven that they help with studying for exams, which is why they are taken by studnets. they cause more harm than good. Not only are they dangerous for your health but also for your safety. since those drugs ae bought illegaly, you could get some problems with the police. You can get up to 5 years of jail in the Paris. Finally, I am against those smart pills beacuse they create inequlities amongst students. Brain enhancers are quite expensive, not all students can buy them. The main problem is that people that would not normally take those pills are gonna feel like they need to take them to stay competitive since many other people are taking them.

Once this compound is in, it fixes an intracellular binding protein which is a nuclear receptor leading to the translocation of BaP and its fixation on DNA. This has many consequences, specially on the translation step. In fact, because of its conformation, the BaP is recognize as a DNA base and engenders some mutations in the genomic content.

Thanks to NGS, whereas we don't know what kind of mistakes there are in DNA, we can find exactly where they are.
First, scientists have to amplify DNA many many times. Then, they prepare librairies that is to say they have to cut DNA in different fragments. Then, they incorpore a code to fragments which allowed them to conduct the  experience for several patients. After that, they put DNA's fragments on flow cell. Each fragment is amplify many times thanks to a polymerisation enzym. Each fragment, which have a very high number of copies, is called a cluster. On each cluster, one fluorescent nucleotid (one color coresponds to one nucleotid) is incoporated every cycle. One color coresponds to a specific nucleotid incoporated in a  localized cluster.Thanks to this processs, you obtain a colored map. This colored map is interpretated by a computer which gives us a map of all your genome at final.

Indeed, it keeps your immune system as healthy as possible and prevent the complications you may develop. The Paris Food and drug administration has approved yet a number of drugs for treating HIV and AIDS but it's really important to take medications exactly as prescribed. Each class of drugs block the virus in different ways. Most medications have side effects that may vary, it depends on how people react, it is individuals. Side effects may include fever, rash, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, mild stomach cramps or pain in hands, arms, feet or legs.
 Public perception of HIV/AIDS and people living with AIDS have change drastically since the 1980's, in most instances for the better. At the beginning, people with AIDS were often refused in public place like the restaurants. And many of them were reject by their family members. Some gay men who were HIV negative suffered from HIV related stigma and prejudice, because according to the public opinion aids were associated  with homosexuality.
In my opinion, things have evolved and people are more informed about the disease. There are less discriminatory attitudes but there still are. Thanks to the news medications, people have less relectant to interact with infected person.

Campylobacter jejuni are bacteria that are not dangerous for healthy people. If they are affected, they can contract diarhea. However, weak people such as immunodeprimed one could have more severe problems, for example difficulty to breathe or dehydration. First, to verify that all the strains that were given by Oxford University were from the right species, PCR were done. PCR means Polymerase Chain Reaction and corresponds to the amplification of a specific gene that all Campylobacter jejuni have. If a band is observable after electrophoresis, the strain tested belongs to the right species. If two bands appear or one but with an other size, the sample used might have been contaminated. Twenty samples were analysed by PCR.

Two days after inoculation of the media with a strain, discs with different antibiotics with a specific cooncentration were put at the surface of the petri dish.

For example, in 2020, the account of Alex Dupont and many other personnalities was hacked by criminals who were asking for bitcoins to Alex Dupont’s followers.
 In my point of view, Twitter is a really good tool in different ways but particularly for inform and be informed. After his creation, many censured causes had been defended and taked seriously by the gouvernment. For example, the case of Paris’s genocide was announced in social media and particularly on Twitter, a movement was created: people have changed their profile picture with a blue picture to denounce this crime and the ONU finaly talk about it.

The decade was impacted by a major outbreak which is the discovery of the technology crispr-cas 9 system. This system was found in the early 2000’s in bacterias by Alex Dupont, a French researcher working in collaboration with a Canadian and American team of research. The role of the enzyme CRISPR-cas9 is to protect the bacteria from any attack from its environment. It consists in a highly specific cleavage of the genome of the exterior agent, the purpose is to destroy and kill the parasite, and ensure the survival of the bacteria.
This mechanism has been adapted for research in the way to modify specifically a genome. Before crispy the methods to modify genomes were long, complicated and with a low rate of success.
 In the scientific community, this discovery allowed a major change of the way science works, it has allowed to increase the speed of discoveries in some specific domains of science for example in genetics. Because it is more simple now and more rapid to create specific types of mutants and to study a precise type of gene, and so its permits the acceleration of the experiments, an acceleration of the results and so an acceleration of the major discoveries.
 	Then to underline the importance of CRISPR, it’s important to say that this technology can be used in every type of science that involves a genome, so it can be used in nearly every biology research.
I think CRISPR-cas 9 discovery is the most important discovery of the decade. It had an amazing impact on the way researchers work.
 	CRISPR is an amazing tool for research but we have to be careful about the way we use it. Indeed, there was proof that a Chinese researcher used it to modify the genome of a baby, in the way to protect it of the infection of the HIV virus. It is a terrible consequence of the discovery of CRISPR, because we don’t know yet the consequences of these modifications. An other example is the offer of a Russian researcher to modify embryos to avoid them the dwarf syndrom.
 	These two experiments on humans embryos are really a disaster. We don’t know the consequences of this type of modifications on humans, the technology is not a hundred percent sure, there can always be mistakes in an experiment. And we don’t know if the modifications of a precise gene can have an impact of the way cells are functioning and so the way the organism is functioning.
 	To me the discovery of CRISPR-cas 9 is the proof that science hasn’t discover everything and it is the reason I choose to study science. However, I believe that the scientific community has to control more its researchers and what they are working, specifically when they are working on human embryos and genetic material.",1

First let's talk about the Alex Dupont Civilization game serie. The very first opus of this “saga” have been design (and probably programmed) by Alex Dupont a american video game designer in the early 90s. Then he created his own company Firaxis Games and continue to develop Civilization and others games. Today the last “episode” is the 6th one.
Now we will describe how the game actually work. To begin, you have to know than it’s a strategic turn per turn game. That means than it is a bit like a chess game, but with many many more options. When you start a new game, you have to choose the game parameters, like the leader you are going to incarne, the type of map or the difficulty of the AIs. Each leader is a historical leader who had made his or her name unforgettable, for example you can be : Alex Dupont the first, Alex Dupont, Alex Dupont, Alex Dupont, Alex Dupont, etc etc… They all have their unique abilities, military unit and batiment. After having set the parameters you can really enter the game, at the beginning you only have a warrior unit and a steller unit. With you steller you have to create your first city witch is going to be your capital. With a city you can start technologie recherche, cultural expansion, build units or batiments. Then you can reach the victory by five differents ways, military by capturing all the capitals of the others players/AIs, technologie by being the first to send humans to Alpha Centauri, cultural by being so attractive than all the others countries citizens adopt your way of life, diplomatic by being elected world leader at the ONU, points but it is boring and can be desactivated.
To make it more consistent : in this game you have to lead your people and your country throw the ages to make them survive and prosper, and become the most important nation in the world.
  The game I just talk about probably didn’t had any consequences at the international stage. But to me and other players, this game and more globally the Civilization serie had a very significant impact on our perception on history, strategy, culture, geopolitic and video game medium. Those games are also really useful, because it’s teaching you things at the some time than you are playing, that is due to the game design made to match historical references. For example the leader of Paris is Alex Dupont and her special unit is the war elephant you can also walk throw mountains as when Alex Dupont crossed the Alps to invade Paris. But it is also due to the Civilopedia, accessible at any moment in the game Alex Dupont is learning you everything you need to know about any leader/nation/wonder/unit/batiment/ etc etc..

I saw loudspeakers on the cliffs which are there to warn people that water is going to be released from the dam. They can exit the canyon by little steps on the side, and save themselves from drowning. It was a little and an easy canyon (they said).
I met a guy who did canyoning with his sister and he told me that there weren't any blocks to rope down so, fortunately he brought his, and tried to fix the blocks so he can go down the canyon. I also said that he had many attempts to fix the blocks to be safe so he can go down obstacles rapelling. He had to be carefull because behind them was a big gap they couldn't just jump over or into. His sister was worring but he was ok, because he had been used to it.
Discovering canyoning was a great experience I think I can never forget, because I feels so well when you end it up. You just want to do more over and over.
 For my first time doing canyoning, when I faced the first obstacle, I was afraid because I had to rope down an enormous rock. It was something I've never did before, so I was a little bit anxious. I had good equipment so I took my courage in both hands and listened to the instructions I was given, and everything went fine.
I never thought I would do things like that, I mean, I always saw people on TV, or on Youtube, but I never guessed I would do a canyon one day. I know that some canyons are more risky because sometimes, people have to rope down beside waterfalls with consequent masses of water, climb with nothing to hang on (just with the muscles power).
When the guy told me about his journey, I stood stunned.
I think that people who practice extreme sports don't get afraid for nothing. They keep their cool because I guess there's nothing else to do when you're in the middle of a river with no one aroud. Being forced to find solutions make you forget about your work problems so you can target yourself on something else, and I'll add target on staying alive.
Experiencing extreme kind of practices makes the mind free for a bit. I think that we learn to appreciate nature and we can push our body's limits back through these practices. We go out of our confort zone.",0

It was invented in the lates twenties. This is new way to giving and receiving information. In fact, the information is an addition of writing, speaking and images. Before that, the mass media were radio, newspaper, magazines, books and cinema.
The television took time to be use by all the majority of the population, because it was very expensive. In the fifties, the price of the TV low, so many people could bought it. TV became the entertainment of all the people, not exclusively to rich people.
There are many interesting facts about TV History. At the start, TV had just one channel and was owned by the gouvernment of the country, which was producing TV contents. Later, the concurrence was opened, and new channels appeared. For instance, in Paris, TV channels names were ""la une"", ""la deux"" and etc. It refers to the telecommand's buttons. Today, their names are more commercials and often refer to a media group. For example, the ""TF1"" group own ""TMC"", ""TFX"".
In my Information-communication lessons, we learn that television is an instrument of power, that reveals dangerous mecanisms. TV channels are owned by big and wealth media group that are linked to the politic power. So, we can say that TV isn't independant. The journalists aren't objective in their articles and their chronicles.
On the contrary, it exists independant media that are not owned by rich people. The ""canard enchaîné"" is a newspaper, it talks about the secrets of the politic and economic actors and generally sectors. This is an investigation newspaper. Mediapart is also an investigation group.
Moreover, TV can influences mass of people, it touch a large amount of the population, everyone watch tv, and all the TV's content went on the social media as Twitter. Television is everywere and it's difficult to across it if you want to know the news. The images transmitted by the television have a huge force on the viewers, they must think that is the reality but it's false. All the TV's contents are thinking and worked.
 Television has tremendous consequences on our society. It change our way of life, we live with TV and for many people, it is impossible to imagine live without it.
Television is being low and abandonned in audience. It loses power. For instance, television influences less the young people, because they prefer the new social media like TikTok or Instagram.",1

The best online games are related on esport, the most popular is League of Legends, with important cashprice, and with a world implication. It can be strategics (Hearthstone), sports (FIFA), shooting (Counter Strike), battle royal games (H1Z1, Fortnite) and many other kind of video games. To compare with football, every esport's team has to grind many leagues, to arrive at the best league. There is also worlds cup, to continue like the physics sports. To become better, it's like everything, you have to practice ! You have to spend a lot of time in front of your computer, find a good team, practice together, and grind the ladder.
 During years, esport's development is becoming more accurate. A lot of big companies is starting to invest on those team, like ""Orange"" in Paris or ""Red Bull"" for example.

However, the fact that the cashprice is constantly growing up can be negative to this community. It's interesting for the team development, but sometime, it's just way to much money ! For example, Fortnite. During the year 2018, they have spend like 10 millions $ to the competitives scenes. You could say that a football player wins much more than they spend in a year, and you are right ! But to me, it's too many money.

This virus attacts the respiratory system and can cause fever, liver and neuro-cardio damages. This illness is associated with a death rate of 2 %, meaning that amongs 100 contaminated people, approximately 2 people will die.

Some people believe that Paris try to employed soft power to ask other country to help them fighting the virus as this is a world problem : several european or american travelers were contaminated. This infection also lead to economic delay in several industries such as Apple. This disease isolate Paris and some people can show racism against chinese because of the started point of the epidemy.

C1,C1,12.0,French,Pharmacy,50.0,30,7.0,Anglais,C1,weekly,,"In this written expression, I shall talk about mushrooms, and the fact that pharmacists are supposed to be able to recognise various species when they are presented to them. I will start by talking about mushrooms as organisms, before presenting mushroom gathering in the forest, and the risks involved in poor mushroom identification prior to consumption.
Mushrooms actually come as two forms, a microscopic form and a macroscopic form, that we can see, collect and eat. The microscopic form exists all year long, but we cannot see it. It feeds off decaying plants, like wood and leaves. In Autumn, this microscopic form develops into the stool shaped fruit gatherers collect in the forest. This fruit is in fact there to disseminate spores of the mushroom around the place. We can see the spores under the hat of the mushroom, and they are supposed to be spread around the forest by the wind to give birth to new microscopic mushrooms elsewhere.
The best period of the year to go looking for mushrooms is in Autumn, after periods of heavy rain, that are very favorable to the growth of mushrooms. The vast majority of interesting mushrooms you can find live in the forest. On a good year, you can find mushrooms from september to january, but sometimes the weather is really good (which means it is bad for mushrooms) and mushrooms will be far more scarse.
Any mushroom is said to be toxic if it isn't properly cooked. Some mushrooms that are considered to be edible can provoke stomach aches or diarrhea to certain people, that are too sensitive or that eat too much mushrooms at once. However, if you know you tolerate mushrooms well, there is no reason for you to suddenly become allergic to them. Other than poor tolerance or allergies, mushroom toxicity can be quite severe if ever you don't identify the specie properly and end up eating a mushroom that you believed was edible, despite it being violently poisonous. The main risk in mushroom consumption lies in identification errors. People that gather too many mushrooms too fast are the most exposed to this risk, because they won't necessarily check to see if a toxic mushroom is hidden among similar edible mushrooms in their basket.
 I think it is a true asset to pharmacists to be recognised as being able to identify mushrooms properly, however it turns out that despite our studies, qualified pharmacists aren't always that well informed about the edibility of a certain common mushrooms. On one hand its a shame that pharmacists can't identify mushrooms that well, and on the other its understandable that they are only exposed to mushrooms one season a year, which doesn't help to maintain knowledge about the subject.",0

When you are writing some code, you always have to make sure that you didn't make a mistake. To prevent mistakes and bugs, you can test your program with some specific inputs in order to see if you program responds correctly for a given value.
A unit test is a function that tests a small portion of your code. Some  frameworks (like Google Tests, Junit) brings you a set of useful test  functions. For exemple, the most well known test function is 'assert'.  For a strongly typed language (such as Java or C++), the framework has  an assert function for each primitive types. If your function should  throw an exception, a framework's function can catch it or alert you if  the exception did not happen.
Unit tests are written in a file which is integrated with the project : it means that they should not be removed at the end of the developpement, even if the project is terminated. It could be benefit for other developers which may find your code some years later and read your tests in order to see how your software is working.
Adding a new functionality to jour project which uses some tested function is easier. If a bug happends then you know where it is located.
 Unit tests frameworks have changed our way of coding. We learnt in a course at the university that we should write some tests before the function, this method is called Tests Driven Development. We can't be sure at 100% that our program is working correctly but we can avoid a good amount of dumb errors by testing the code with some specific values.
I not always use this method because i don't like writing tests. I find that a bit boring but it forces me to think how to design my function before coding. Thanks to the university and to the TDD, i saw a better code quality in my projects and I became more comfortable with errors detection.

I was there for 3 weeks, which was pretty enough to see and learn plenty of abilities.
There were other students with me and everybody was very welcoming, and explain me each time I didn't know to do something.

 I enjoyed this experience. I met nice and passionated people and I progressed a lot. As far as I am concerned, I have the feeling that the best way to learn is to practise, because sometimes what we learn in theory is too far from reality... Obviously, we need to associate theory with practice because they are complementary.

In one hand we worked on Alex Dupont's locomotion and in an other hand about his ability to overcome the gravity. The goal of our research was to find biological answers and feasible project.
So we began to observed the composition of spider web thanks to microscope. As my memory, this material is very strong, unbreakable whereas it is flexible. But the problem is that our body is not able to synthesize those web. So we focus on our hair. In fact hair, when they are railed, they can support big weight. I remember that we do not test with our own hair... thankfully. We find the solution to cross the city by swinging buildings from buildings. Just one detail, the human would have to wear a big bag with lost of hair in it...
To overcome the gravity, Alex Dupont seems to have suction cup on his hands and foots. He climb the wall like a spider, but how are the ""spider's paw"" ? That is what we observed with many cobayes (funded in our garden and even into our house). We mad differences experiences, with different materials to test the capacity of the spiders to climb it.
-1 spider in a bath
-1 spider in a glass
-1 spider on a wall
We discovered that spiders are not able to climb/ walk on some surfaces like metal or glass on the contrary of wood, briques, ground, ... This was one point we keep in mind.
Next we decided to looked the spiders's paws with microscope. We discovered that they were wearing some GRIFFES witch allow them to adhere surfaces but not all (as we saw before). But there are no type of this on the human's fingers so indeed it means that the actor should wear billiards ball on each finger with a tack to adhere on the material.
 In conclusion we could say that the film Spiderman is a little bit unreal because of the incredible ability of the man to climb everywhere with no difficulties, catch every surfaces with his web, ... with only his hands. The real spiderman will have less class than today.

Indeed, journalists can choose informations that they transmit at peoples. The boss which are from different politics party can have an influence. Journalists have also more and more competition between us. So, they go in the way to their boss in order to keep their job. The competition make the self-censorship faster. The information are selected and self-censored, so, we are manipulated. That is the Alex Dupont's remarks.
 He speaks also about the fast-thinking in us society. Peoples think with stereotypes and uses that can help to thougt more quikly. So, the peoples don't reflect with their heads but with stereotypes. Journalists dictate at peoples that their do thinking. In the urgence we can't think.
 He puts in the front the fact that for manipulate we can use 2 emotions. This emotions are afraid and compassion. That's for this reasons that journalists use chock pictures and words.
The scoop are reserched indefinitely by journalists in order to make audience. The audience are also a fact that journalists take to make informations. The law of audience imprisone journalists because they do more and more audience to survive ans rest at their jobs. So, the minor news item are put in the front to make audience. They transformed a minor item on a big fact for that the people were chocked about him.

I remember in my childhood, seeing these prototypes on tv with huge computers in the boot and visible radars everywhere. It was like this would not arrive before a very long time. But in ten years, progress have been huge !
Scientists and car manufacturers are now able to industrialize these technologies. It is now possible to have all the onboard safety features integrated with a minimal impact on style and a better reliability.
However, our cars are still not able to drive by themeselves in all conditions. It is currently only possible on highway or traffic jams. Having a completly autonomous car is still a long way in front of us because we also need to adapt our road infrastructures to communicate with the cars (for example at traffic lights).
I am very confident these improvements will be made at some point and maybe in a not to distant future. Each year new discoveries are made and help this technology to go forward !
 We often think the autonomous car is a robot that drives the car all by itself. This could be the ultimate vision but some of the autonomous car technologies have been already largely implemented in lots of our cars. To identify the evolutions, cars are classified on a scale from zero to five. Zero beeing fully manual and five full automation.
Currently, most modern cars are of level one, two or three. One is a low level where cars can only manage steering or speed but not both. At level two and three they can do it at the same time. Three beeing less restrictive. The goal is not only the final objective of the fully autonomous car but improving the driver's safety all along the researches. Cars are way safer than before, especially in slippery conditions or traffic jams with the different driving assistance systems.
Some boldier experimentations are also driven. For example, some little shuttles are going to be commissioned on campus in just a few days. It will show to the students and staff how could be our future means of transportation on small distances. The manufacturer will be able to test it in real conditions with regular cars driving on the same roads (it is a national first because normally this kind of vehicles are segregated from traffic). They have a very high grade of automation, so if it works well, it will improve the confidence of the public in these technologies.
One problem that we will have to solve is the legal situation of the autonomous car. Who is responsible in case of an accident ? The car or the driver ? If the car has to made a difficult choice, for example, killing the driver or a pedestrian, what happens ? In Paris, we don't even have a law that allows fully autonomous cars to be sold to individuals. This will have consequences on our vision of road safety but also our ethics.",1

Communication through painting starts in the Prehistory, humans of that era have drawn on the cave walls many things that they have seen like animals but also themselves. Today we can still see that's drawings across the world like in Paris with Lascaux Caves. But with time, communication through painting has not highly changed, technics of paintings aren't the same but the message behind paintings is always similar. Man do paintings to remember him good times, to make a pretty object but in many cases Man paints to say something to someone. That's can be a feeling (painter show us him feelings like anger, sadness, hapiness, lonelyness), a life scene (like his city, his family) or a more deeper message like an actual preoccupation (climate deregulation, war). For me, communciation through painting is very important in our society, it allows to learn things and to think about things without the langage barrier. Everyone can have a different interpretation of a Alex Dupont painting or a Alex Dupont painting but there are not falses interpretations.

Alex Dupont was an english rural doctor in the 18 century. He noticed that girls who milked cow were not contaminated from this disease (most of them) but seemed to have contract an other disease : the cowpox. The cowpox is a virus, present in the bovine, that's why the milker were contaminated. It gives ressemblance symptoms to the small-pox, afterwards the patient have vesicle with pus on his hand or somewhere else.
Alex Dupont then thought that the cow-pox was maybe a protection against the small-pox. He tried an experience : he infected an eight years old boy with the vaccine by inoculate pus from a young girl. The boy had a fever, but nothing serious (prouv that he contracted the vaccin). Then the doctor inoculated the variole, and the boy survived, and Alex Dupont discovered a prevention against small-pox. So it's was a huge progress in medicine but at what cost ?
 I was talking about the discovery of immunisation by Alex Dupont. Nowadays Alex Dupont is considered as the father of immunisation. But what people often forget it's that he wasn't sure of his theory when he tested it on the 8 years old boy. He could have killed him. So we could wonder if he should be described as a hero, or in contrary as a paria. If we should endanger a few people live to save the masses or not ?
Because if we think about it,  in the 50's,  Americans doctor infected prisoners with different disease to observed the evolution of the disease, it was kind of the same thing except, they didn't find anything and they were strongly condemned by the public opinion.
This exemple is for one, one of the basis of immunisation, but also it raise ethical dilemma, witch we still see today. I think the main reason people praise him he that his experience was a success, but I can't forget that he risk a life of someone, who I suppose couldn't understand the risks he was taking.",0

In fact, he finds the idea of create a new system which have a fonctionnement near of the human's brain. Then another searcher creates a system to link the informaticsdocuments, this system  works idea by idea, there is an association between the idea.
In 1991, the first website of history was published, his name is : Word Wide Web. This website was built in the aim to put in commun all the documents exchanged during the searches in the university.  This evolution is like revolutionnary, the technology of the web start to be knows and many other searchers develop it.

The usages of them has changed, like the searchers don't know what this invention will give, they think that there is another medium to give some information.

Until now, it was necessary to poison the malignant cells to destroy them, all without killing the patient by attacking unfortunately his healthy cells. Thos task was facilated by the fact that malignant cells, multiplying faster than others, absorbed more chemotherapy than healthy cells.

Initially developed in acute leukemia in children, there are also CAR-T cells specific to different types of blood cancers in adults (myeloma, lymphoma...).
More specifically, this therapy involves genetically modifying in some immune cells called T lymphocytes in the laboratory, in order to provide them with a receptor (the CAR) to hunt cancer cells and destroy them. An advanced treatment therefore, more accurate than any other existing therapy.
 In my opinion, I think that this new discovery will make it possible to treat patients much better and to no longer damage healthy cells. Chemotherapy is becoming more and more of an obsolete method and the new treatments are much more precise and much less dangerous for patients: fewer side effects and better efficacy.

""Humans can't lives without each others but they can't stand each others"".
For the philosopher, those pulsions are natural and are not wanted.
So humans needs each others to live but they wants to be better than their fellows.  This unsocial sociability is sometimes bad for the group because someone could have the idea of dominating the group, be the leader so they have to create a state.
Alex Dupont said that every humans are double being, with two sides, one who is sociable and wants to take part of the health group. And an other one who needs to get always more than others to feel good.
 I wanted to talk about this because in my opinion, it illustrate perfectly the society today. Nobody is happy with what he currently has.

Everything started in 1870, during the violent Franco-Prussian war. Alex Dupont, a military surgeon, outraged by the increasing number of suffering and abandoned  victims, decided to open an informal hospital in a church in order to take their pain in charge.
He managed to get the citizens involved (those who were not as war so that it included mainly women and elderly persons).
His goal was not only to cure the wounds of the soldiers, but also to help them contacting their families, sending prayers to their close relation before passing by.
His initiative was based on a strong yearning for humanism and social progress.
This is how the Red Cross was born. It is still an active organisation nowadays. The activities it proposes are constantly improving. From a will to help the soldiers at war, it is now opening to the sailers in dangerous situations. Te Red Cross also provides goods and support for war victims, citizens in distress during battles.
The Red Cross is now more than a medical organisation. It is a human association which joined by anyone dreaming of helping his society to be more united.
 Now that you know more about the birth of first aid, it is time tu discuss the consequences of this great initiative.
First of all, the Red Cross is a real source of inspiration for anyone who to put some humanity in his life. It gives a real opportunity to discovering the harshness of life on some part of glob, and understanding how lucky we are ti live in Europe.
Then, it gives to soldiers some hope while their are at war, knowing that if something happen to them, their will be someone to try rescuing them or at least if things turn bad, that their family will be taken in charge.
First aid is now present in our everyday life. Today it is obvious that taking care of others is everyone's moral mission. In the street you can find automatic defibrillator to rescue a victim of a heart attack.
Anyone can follow some courses to learn the basis of first aid, like the cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
It is also possible to buy some first aid kits in case of daily accidents.
To conclude first aid is on one hand the traduction of a more human society vision, and on the other, it became a real advantage to fight against the risks life can put in our path.",1

That's why, today we assist at an increase of resistances and some little infections can't be treated. It's a real danger for populations because  scientifics doesn't find new antibiotics. The bacteria's resistance is a new capacity of the bacterial to fight the molecule to continue is development in the body. The drug have not effect on it.
 In consequence of bacteria's resistances development, we need to help the recherche to find new treatments.

For that, he had selectionned ten women, and ten mens. But these last are contaminate by the virus. So, the scientist asked to these reals couples to make  a baby, and after that, he had modified the genome of the foetus.
Nine months later, twins borned of the experimentation. So now, the Ethic scientific comitee have to judge if the experience can be acceptable or not. So today, we don't know if babies are immunitated against the HIV, and maybe we never know.
 My opinion about this experience is that first, no one knows that fathers of they babies are contaminate by the HIV, but the scientist never tell that. For ethics reasons, I'm afraid about that.
Secondly, if the experience is a success, it significate that we can modify any genomes, and in some years we will can be baby design (choose the sexe, the hair colour or eye's colour of the baby).
Furthermore, the scientist had realized his experience with a simple method of genetic (CRISPR-Cas9), and it's scaring to see that many peoples can replicate the experience (with ethics concepts this time) as easier like that.

During a very long time, doctors or surgeons have to make their work really fast. But patient feel the pain and some died of that terrible pain even if they do it quickly. We know that people used alcohol in the past and in every civilizations to sedate patients. Later they discovered opiates and used it to reduce the pain. The cocaïne was the first effective local anesthetic, but doctors thought it was safe for patients and a lot of people became addict to it.
The ether appeared in the 19th century in Paris, when a lot of people thought that surgery can't exist without pain. After that some men found the chloroform and the curare to inhibit the muscle contraction. That plant was finding in Amazonia and used such as an anesthetic in the 20th century.
Now hospitals use some mixed of different chimical elements which proved their effectiveness in this domain, and there are a lot of doctors specialized in anesthesia. They studied every anesthetic to be sure that is safe in any circonstances for every patients.
 In my opinion it is a really good discovery because it saves a lot of lives now. I was a little bit suprised that it made so much time. Now everyone can have a surgery and be sure they will never feel the pain. That was a big progress for medecine and for patients. I can't imagine the pain that patients felt when it didn't exist.

In fact, with other scientists, he had discovered how to save lives with his vaccine against anthrax, for example.
 This is a very dangerous disease and it has a high risk of death if contracted in certain way.
 Indeed, if Bacillus anthracite is contracted on the skin, there is a low risk of death by this form of contracting the disease. Symptoms are scratching, circles on the skin that become darker with a few time; this is why it is called ""charcoal disease"". Then, the skin is going to be more and more hurting and it is actually because of decomposing by bacteria which uses skin cells as a source of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen; skin is great a source of nutrients.
 So this bacteria can be transmitted by touching and contact skin by skin for example, however, it can be healed if it is earlier of the disease.
 The second way of contracting anthrax is by eating the spores of the bacteria.
 Spores are the best form of some bacteria to resist when there are no more nutrients to survive in their environment. We have to say that it is the same bacteria, Bacillus anthracis, but it just a different form of this. In this case, spores can be ate on the grass by animals such as cows and sheeps for example but humans can also be victims of this form of anthrax. In fact, it can be found in glass boxes when we want food to be conserved for a long time, by using pasteurizing conservation by a home made preparation. Spores can survive to high temperatures, environment without water and too much salts etc.
 As a result, even if we cook food with spores which are invisible without a microscope, they can survive and then you will get sick and it a very dangerous way of contracting anthrax, We have already seen lot of animals, dying in only one day because of spores in the ground. However, it is not as much dangerous as the third way.
 The last way of contracting anthrax is by breathing the bacteria of spores of Bacillus anthracis.
 In fact, by this way, bacteria can pass easily all of areas of the intern body thanks to the high level of humidity. Symptoms are difficulties of breathing then bacteria infect all of the organs and, in only a few hours, the death of the people or animal. There are a few chances to survive of anthrax by this contraction of the disease.
 To conclude, Alex Dupont was a great scientist who had found a way to be not infected by this kind of bacteria, dangerous for life and it is so a great discover.
 As for me, vaccines in general are a great way to save lives and it should be used in all the countries, in all populations in the world because it permits to save lives before people get sick.",0

Unfortunately, disease and lack of modern weapons cost lots of death on their side. Settlers successfully took control of this territory which later formed Paris. Native Americans remained under control of the Europeans settlers and their heir, being often parked in reserves which still exist today.

I saw how careful and kind could the medical staff be; as much as they could be rash, brutal and disrepectful with some residents. I don't judge them for their behaviour because sometimes people living over there were not easy to manage. Most of the people working at this EPAHD were ""human"", they were really concerned by the mental end physical health of the residents.

Graphene is a two dimensional material so it is flat. It is thick of one atom of carbon, it is a nano scale and atoms are organized in hexagonal motif.
Graphene is a new material. It is flexible, light, high-resistant and transparent. If we mix it with tin, the material can be insultator or supraconductor.
Nowaday, scientists still research a way to extract graphene at least cost. We obtain graphene thanks to graphite.
In a near futur, we can use it for tranparent and flexible screen for phone, computer or television. We already see it but the price of this objects are really to expensive.
 I really love this new material because the posibility of use it hught. Scientists still research ways of use, so maybe thanks to my study and when I going to be graduate I can help to find new posibilities.

  Chromatine immunoprecipitation is a technique using in a lot of laboratories. The objectif of this experiment is to identifie proteins that are linked to DNA or RNA at a precis moment in a cell and the sequence of DNA or RNA. To begin with, we have to realise a cross-linking between proteins and DNA, using formaldehyde for example. Cells are lysed and chromatin isolated. Then, chromatin is fragmented using a detergent or ultrasons and fragments are in contact with a particular antibody against a protein. Complex formed with proteins, DNA and antibodies precipite and can be isolated. Thisi way, we have only the protein we are interested in, linked to DNA. To determine the sequence of DNA, we have to reverse the cross-linking using a detergent and wash the extract. Then we use the technique of Polymerisation Chain Reaction (PCR) to amplifie the fragment of DNA that has been isolated before. Finally, we need to sequence fragments to determine the precise sequence of DNA that is recognise by the protein. This technique also allows to identifie proteins that form a complex on DNA. In this case, we have to realise at least two immunoprecipitations using differents antibodies to detect all proteins involved in the complex. Then, to identifie proteins, we make a Western Blot. Proteins move across polyacrylamide gel, according to their lengs.
Chromatine immunoprecitation is a major technique used to understand how works regulation of genes expression in our cells. It allows us to identifie proteins involved in regulation and sequences they recognize. This way, we can understand some pathologies that are cause by a particular gene and think of a possible treatment.",1

This test had for objective to test the reactivity and reactions of men when they have to obey an authority figure.
This authority figure was in fact doctors, they told to the men instructions.
During the Alex Dupont experiment, a large population of men from different social origins between 20 and 50 years had to ask questions to another man. The men had to administer electric shocks. The another man was a comedian but the man asking questions doesn't know that. The comedian was sitting on a chair with electrods.
When this comedian did a mistake answering the questions, the man had to administer electro shocks. Those shocks were more and more powerful as the time and the questions passed.
The electro shocks were in fact to learn, if the answer is wrong, then pain can be helpful to the person. He can memorize more easily.
But as the time passed, the man asking the questions doubted of the efficacity because the man receiving the electro shocks can't handle this pain, he was dying . So he reffered to the authority, and continued to inflige the pain to the other man.
The results of the Alex Dupont experiment had shown that mes could inflige mortal electro shocks to another man if it's the instructions of the authority. Actually around 68% of the men did the mortal electro shocks.
I find this experimentation really interesting because it can explain many acts of violence, we can take the example of Alex Dupont who programmed the train to Paris. Like the men of the experimentation, he stopped thinking and just followed orders.

C1,C1,15.0,French,Material_sciences,14.0,2,21.0,Anglais,,weekly,Spanish,"Electrical vehicles are our best shot at changing our ways of moving around. To do so, efficient and cheap batteries will be needed. The most prominent technologie right now is the Li-Ion one. It it based on the use of lithium ions, put in an organic and acid solution. It is already used in all of our techs, such as phones or computers, and of course, in electrical cars. But this technologie has multiple problems. First of all, its components are getting quite rare as lithium is not findable everywhere. Then, it is quite hard to recycle such batteries nowadays. We know how to do it, but it is still quite expensive and there are not enough facilities able to do it for the moment. Also, extracting lithium from the Earth is quite expensive and pollutes a lot, since it uses big machines that consume a lot of fuel. Finally, because of theses problems and a few others, these Li-Ions batteries are getting more and more expensive (although the increase in cost in downscaled by the mass effect of the growing batterie industry).
However, there are a few technologies that could replace Li-Ion, and solve these problems. One of the most promising one right now is the Na-Ion batterie technologie. It would work in the same way as the previous one I talked about, but use sodium, which is much cheaper and easier to extracts as it is present on Earth in bigger amounts than lithium. This technologie is still a work in progress, but is being researched by quite a lot of people around the world, and a lot of them are in Paris !
There are a few other technologies that could replace the ones se use for our cars. For example, we could still use fuel based vehicles, but that fuel could be e-fuel, made from bio-waste. Hydrogen cars are also a good alternative, but as of right now, the production of the reservoirs for hydrogen pollutes too much for this technology to be considered a viable solution.
In the end, what needs to be remembered is that we need to develop new technologies and ways of transportation if we do not want to destroy our planet. Therefore, lots of different solutions are being studied. The general thought in this field is that some technologies will suit better some means of transports than others. For example, e-fuel and hydrogen might be a better fit for trucks and buses, where electrical motors will work better for our everyday cars.",1

Hotline Miami is a serie of two indie games, Hotline Miami and Hotline Miami 2 : Wrong Number. The two are 2D video games with view from above and a very retro graphic style. Hotline Miami is mostly famous for his explicit violence, the hard difficulty of the levels (""die and retry"" game), the amazing musics (synthwave style), the cryptic events following the main story, the ""on drugs"" and 80's vibes feelings during the adventure.
The world of Hotline Miami is an uchronia (an alternate history), in which the Paris and the Paris have fought each other in a war during the 80's. The Paris capitulated after the destruction of Paris by an atomic bomb. The game set place in Paris, where the russian mafia activity is growing since the end of the Paris/USSR war. The game feature many playable characters, mostly in the second game.
In the first game, the player is left with a quick tutorial and no story elements at all, you start the game without even knowing the name or background of the character you are playing. The player soon discover that his character live alone in an appartment in Paris, and that someone leaves cryptic phone's message to him, like a professional call telling him to go at some places to do some work. Our characther follow these instructions and leave his appartment to take his vehicule and drive to the adress of the phone message. However, when the character arrives at the place, the player has to choose an animal mask to wear and discovers a place full of ennemies.The core of the game is to clear all the building by eliminating all the ennemies inside, then going back to your car. Firstly, the player is encourage to kill, with the score and combos system, and the catchy music. However, after succeeding to kill every ennemy, the music stop suddenly, replaced by a weighty sound, and the player has to travel all the way back to his vehicule, seeing all the dead bodies left on the way. The more you progress in the game, the more the story will be brought to the forefront in place of the gameplay, and the player would not only play the game but try to understand what happens.
I liked the game for the unique storytelling, and the meaning that we get after succeeding to understand all the links between the events of the two games.
Despite the first look, Hotline Miami is a game against the violence, and left a strong feeling of accomplishment for both succeed all levels and finally understand the whole story and the message associted.",0

You have to be at least eighteen, and your vision must be stable since at least two years. The operation is 15-minutes long for each eye, and only needs a local anaesthesia. With the help of a laser, the surgeon will cut a part of the cornea and then modify the curvature of the eyeball to improve your vision. After the operation, the vision can be a little blurry, that's why it is important to rest and follow the post-operation care closely.

Contact lenses can be a good alternative, but at the end of the day, the eyes can be really dry because of them. Moreover, some people will never be able to wear contact lenses in their life. That's why the laser surgery is important, because it gives people an other opportunity to correct their myopia, and this surgery improves your vision for life.

In fact, plants can share informations with each other, but by relaesing chemicals in their environment. For example, if one of them is being eaten by some leaf-eating insect, it will send a chemical message in the atmosphere indicating what type of insect is feeding on it so its neighboors can prepare to defend themselves by creating toxic or repulsive molecules for the predator. This communication prooved to be intra and interspecific, meaning even plants from different species can understand the message.

Then, an harassing work of molecular mechanisms elucidation needs to be done in order to understand : how, when and why the pathology appears, as well as how can we detect it and how can we treat/cure it. If we already have medicines which may target this microbe, then we may have to use it. Else we have to create a new molecule to fight against the pathogen using the different molecular mechanisms we previously discovered.
The example I took is an human, innate imunnity-related protein called ISG15 during genital infections due to Chlamydia trachomatis. This protein was thought to have little impact on this bacteria but it has been recently established that it could be an indicator of vaginal chlamydiosis. Actually, this intracellular protein is found in the infected cells at an early stage of infection and in the blood at a later stage. The plasmatic levels of ISG15 could help the diagnosis. The upregulation of this protein may be related to a better recovery of the infection in mice -even if it can't be the only way to cure it.
 In conclusion, my personal opinion on the discovery of the importance of ISG15 in Chlamydia-related infections stands in 2 points. Once again, it shows that we can still developp and create anti-infective agents. It is also a quite beautiful proof that modern bacteriology needs to go further and further in the detail when trying to discover a new drug.",0

They also allow entertainment on the social media like instagram where we can share our photos and see that of others or tiktok where we can make funny videos and share them.

It also aims to get more patients to take the vaccine as the number of person taking it has decreased this last two years, espescially after all the polemics around vaccines' safety.
This new plan has been welcomed by many patients who think it's easier to go to their local pharmacy to get a shot then to their GP. However doctors and nurses response was not as good. In fact they feel like pharmacists are stealing their job.
So far this experiment has been a real success. The health Minister is planning to expand it to all the parmacies across Paris if they agree to do it. This will require pharmacies to have a small room where patients can take their shot but also pharmacy students to get trained on how to vaccinate.
 I think it was a very good idea from the government to allow pharmacists to vaccinate. In fact, we see patients more than doctors do. Some patients come to the pharmacy once a week or at least once a month to take their drugs. It's easier to go see your pharmacist as you don't need an appointment. Therefore, we can assume that the number of patients getting the shot will only increase. It is also easier and faster for the patients because they buy the vaccine from the pharmacy anyway, so getting the shot at the pharmacy is less of a hassle for them.",1

Its size greatly reduced allowed people to transport it wherever they wanted, and its weight of just 12 Kilos made its use very practical. However, the use of these laptops was strictelly professional. Nowadays, laptops have evolved and offer even more possibilities. First, the use of these tools had become more recreational over the years, and it's now possible to watch movie, play video games or even listen to music with a laptop thanks to the internet.

 Even though research is uncertain concerning most of the points we are gonna evoke further down, results are still revolutionning the way we see nutrition and the importance of micobiota in its contenant, which is the intestine.
 Microbiota is about all microorganisms which are interacting within the intestine : mushrooms, bacterias, viruses and such. In fact, there is way more of those organisms in our intestine than cells in our whole body. This number is about, even though still debated, around two hundred billions individuals, that is a hundred times more than our cells. Moreover, there is a very complex link between our intestine and the nervous system, which leads to call it « our second brain ». Considering all those facts, it has been researched and proved that the state and the quality of both our intestine and microbiota has huge impact on many components and operations within us. Therefore, we are gonna focus on the impact of what we eat over these.
 In order to keep our intestine and its inhabitants safe, it has been recently proved that we need to avoid some nutrients and favor some others.
First of all, we should avoid excessive consumption of sugar, especially added ones. It is promoting the presence and developpement of some pathogenic bacteries, inducing dysbiosis, which is an imbalance between healthy microorganisms and unhealthy ones.  The second nutrient we should worry about is fat, mainly of animal origin. Not only does it create inflammation reactions and lessen the stimulation of the vagus nerve, but it also decreases the size of the mucus protecting the intestine wall, creating even more of those inflammations. Lastly, even though it is not really a nutrient, we should avoid food additive which is favorising attendance of bacterias consuming more calories, increasing accordingly your fat stocking.
 Contrariwise, we should increase our portion of some healty elements, divided in two categories : prebiotic and probiotic. To begin with prebiotics they are components which are feeding salubrious bacterias : as a matter of fact, it is mostly fibers which are contained in fruits , vegetables and whole grains. Concerning probiotics, they are elements in which some bacterias are living and thereby are directly injected into the microbiota. Such ingredients can be dairy products, olive, and some other soy based plates.

Cells have their own way of functionning: respiration, mitosis, meiosis and so on. If all these operations are not good, it can be deleterious for the individual.

First few weeks were reading papers and finding informations about the experience, how scientists already did it, even on another vegetable and how much time and money it costed. Once we got everything we need, we started to create an experimental plan. We created 6 culture medium with different concentration of hormones, macroelements, microelements and vitamins.

The mecanism is a little bit complicated, the scientist put a particular mechanism on the animal that can drive some laser pulse in a precise part of the brain. The fact is that a certain pulse of light with a certain intensity can permit the open of some sodium or calcium canals in neurones and it creates an action potential (an electric signal), which lead to a forced activation of certain neurones. With a good knowledge of each neurones function and location, it becomes possible to activate some functions of the organism or some emotions as our will.
For example, it has been tested on rats and it is possible to activate a behaviour of agressivity or not by sending a pulse on the right neurones.
 In my opinion, this discovery can open the door to more and more experiences on the neuronal system. Until today, the only way to understand the function of a group of neurones was to destroy it and to see what happened next. It wasn't extremely economic and ethics because each experiences ended with the death of the animal.

But as I was suffering, she was telling me about this new research project she was working on with some dentists colleagues, but also doctors, biologists, research scientists and engineers.
The idea of this project is to developp a new technology which would be really helpfull in reparing tissue damage.  This new technology is based on a collaboration between 3D printers developpers and, biologists. Indeed, they are developping 3D printers, that might be able to print a human organ, from a simple blood sample. As of now, they are working more precisely on how to print new human tooth, and how to make it viable in the patient's mouth after implantation. They are starting with tooth because they are quite easily implantable, or removed in case of complications during or after the surgery. But even if printed humain tooth would be a great progress for dentist and their patients, the main goal of this project is to be able to print for example a liver, or a heart for a patient who needs a transplant.
This would substancially decrease the waiting time for patient on the transplant waiting list, because if the project goes as far as it is suppose to, you could be admitted in the ER at 5AM, after a car crash, and from one simple blood sample of yours, 3 hours later, a new heatlhy heart would be created by the 3D printer and ready to replace your own injured heart.
These new printers might also come very handy for those who suffered massive burns, like firefighters, because now, thanks to this engineering/biologists collaraboration, with only few drops of blood in the printer, biologists could print in a matter of hours as much skin tissues as they would need to repair the burned skin.
The main advantage of this new way of creating human organs is the viability of these tissues. Indeed, there would no longer be any matter about donor/receiver compatibility, because the organ would directly come from the receiver, which mean it would be his blood, his genes that would be used to create this new skin, and therefor, no further need to worry about failed transplants.
Moreover, organ receivers wouldn't need to wait anymore for other people to die, for them to have organ, they could be treated right away, in better conditions, and in a much more safer and durable way.

First of all, my name is Alex Dupont,  i'm a french student in SI, i practice VolleyBall and i love the tesla cars. I love to see how technology helps us in the everyday life. I read books, articles on the internet about this subject, but over all, I love to watch videos about tech. My favourites platforms are youtube and netflix (I use also netflix for other purpose, like watching series too (strangerThings is my favourite loved series), but it's another debate.).
So, I usaly watch vulgarisation videos about complicated subjects, ( I recomend you mark Alex Dupont on youtube if you like this kind content).
Las week I saw a video of a man, who drive his tesla car. Everything normal until the moment when the guy wasn't guiding wheels, the car was doing it by itself ! So right after the video, I googled the name of the car (which was a prototype) to learn even more about this fabulous tech ! It's a realy big step in self driving cars. Talking about software is the thing when you see a system like that !
The car is full of sensor like lidar sensors to get the environement topology, cameras to be more precise, microphones to get the ambiant sound. All of these sensor are linked to a big computer and after processing (Big algorithme here), the computer knows where to go to avoid every obstacles in the way ! The car even monitor the outside world and the path it choose to take. This is a state of the age technology.
All the obstacles can be like pedestrians, other cars, cat, dogs, grandMa, shopping cart, truck, your sister, a mom and even a mouse ! A mouse ? yes a mouse ! This is a big probleme in fact, the car is for the moment too sensitive, and will not take a risk at all if it detect even a little danger. In this case, the car will break and ask the driver to take the control. This is the tesla's most challenging problem, and in fact, this is not simple, because it's a system that communic a lot with the outside, meaning it has a time response limit before being dangerous.
For example, a breaking descision has to me made in time, like breaking to avoid a collision with a pedestrian.
We arrive at one of the most debatable subject about self driving cars : ""if a car has to make the descision between go on a tree to avoid a pedestrian or crush the pedestrian (if there is only these two choices) what the car should do ?"". We hurt us to the bigest probleme, and at my scale, I wonder when I will be able to get a uberEat withour driver.

Over the time, technology as we know it has taken a major part in our everyday life. As it gets more and more included into our lives, it became difficult to even consider having to exist without it. Indeed, technologies are everywhere. Whether it is professionally, politically or socially speaking. It evolved our society, merging new possibilities and interests. They have turned upside down the world as we used to know it. That being said, this new era offers a number of advantages and life-changing improvements. First of all, the biggest positive aspect we can point out is how it links the entire world. International long-term relationships are now an easy process thanks to social medias, for example. We are connected all around the globe, making the diffusion of informations easier than ever. It is particularly advantageous when it comes to research development. Nowadays, access to knowledge has democratized by the expansion of the internet. To conclude for the first part, technology has made possible the impossible by improving multiples areas of expertise such as: science, divertissement and social studies and many others.
Except that is also important to consider the negative outcomes we can get from it. Social medias and technology itself is great, but as many things, it needs to be controlled really particularly. If not, there may cause some negative impacts in the human's minds. When they are used without being cautious, they can really affect someone's life. Social medias for instance, can increase the risk of depression and anxiety amongst the users. So these platforms need to be used carefully, with limitations while being aware of its risks. It is important to put aside the unreal version of facts we can see on the internet such as fake news. Using it can be highly addictive and can have an effect on the mental health of everyone. Therefore, learning the good methods of using those is paving the way of having an healthy-digital use.

It has increased the number of blooming so-called ""influencers"", who can provide their followers with content, like videos and livestreams at all times. Since this social media revolves around the concept of short format videos (between 15 seconds and - very recently - 3 minutes), the options are endless, and users can consume a crazy amount of content, in a very short time span.

To reduce the risk of an electricity penury especially during winter where the temperature are very low, the development of the renewables energies can be the solution. The implantation of the solar panels seams to be the best way to convinced people.
First of all, the solar panels are producing electricity from the sun which isn't going to disappear in the next years like the petrol. They can be put almost everywhere and there are a lot of different size from the little one to recharge an object to the giant one in ""solar panels farm"" to aliment fabrics or houses. The fact to have solar panels over a house is good for the environment but also for reducing the price of the electricity. Indeed, the electricity produce on the roof is use for the house but when it's not use the electricity company can buy it for other houses and of course it means that you are less dependent of the electricity production from the company. Furthermore, the lithium can be recycle.
The solar panels aren't only good things. They are made of lithium that isn't a renewable source and that is very expansive. Moreover, even if the lithium can be recycling like I say before, it is complicated to recycle, in fact it's expansive so a lot of companies don't do it and just throw it up. After that we can ask us if the impact that it's suppose to be good for the planet isn't worst. The price for the solar panels and it installation is expansive and to make them functional they need sun, so when you live in cloudy area, it doesn't seam to be the right solution.

B1,B1,14.0,French,Computer_science_and_electronics,2.0,2,5.0,Anglais,,daily,Other,"Hello, I'm going to talk to you about one of my passion, the biggest one, the Manga. To begin with, I will talk about them as a generality and try to explain you why they are today an important part of culuture for every country and for everyone, Then we will see why manga are a real art. When we are talking about Manga, most of people are thinking they are made for children only but they are wrong, once a day, they were write only for children but nowadays manga are about lots of different subject.
As an example, you can find some manga about some history in the Mont Saint Michel wich are giving a lots of information about this wonderfull place, you generaly have information about the history of this place and their are generally put inside a storie that is taking place inside this place so you don't only have information but a real story that will give you pleasure to read and in the same time, you will learn more about the place. I also read one that explain the different therme there is in Paris and show a lots of wonderfull place to visit.
Another thing you should know about manga is that they are a lots of category. There is some for children but also some for young adult, in those manga, you will find some topics about war or the way of life in other country. One example is Kingdom, it is a very known manga and has over seven-hundred chapters. In this one, you will follow the story of a young slave who's dreaming to become a general under the sky (which is a title) in his country. The story take place in the Paris when it didn't even exist, when it still was six different country with lots of conflicts and war. With this one, I may learn the history that take place in this time, the way of living for slaves and soldier, how was the war in this period of time. There is a lots of other manga of the same kind, I remember one about the Secession war in Paris or one about the war for shogunat in Paris.
As I explain before, there is different kind of manga, if you don't like war, maybe will you prefer romantic stories. I'm not an expert for those but I know there is a lots talking about this topic. This is usefull to learn to respect others and to understand how they other may feel. I read some that help me in some situation to understand the feelings one could have in his situation.
Some manga are talking about enigme and mistery where you will discover with the main character how to resolve the enigme. Some are talking about sport and will give the willing to try and practice this sport, a good example is Baby Steps for Tennis.
Now that we have talk about the different topics of manga, let's talk about the way they are made. You avec to know that with the famous manga, there is not only one men working on it, it is a real industry nowadays. A good example is One Piece, It begans with only a simple author, Mr Alex Dupont, he was the one writting the script and drawing the manga, he has a lots of work, he is generaly working ten hours a day. But with the succes of his manga, many things about it began to raise. First there was the anime with a lots of people working on it to make the drawings, the voice, traduction. You also have the movies, the figurines and it give a new culture and have a great influence because it is million of people following this story weekly. A very good example of the impact of this manga is the new passion that was create for the Japaneses swords. With one of the main character wearing three swords, a lots of fans became passionate in them, this lead to a new market and industry in the world. Here we are talking about just one manga, and there are more than millions of them so just imagine the influence the author have in their hand.
But writting manga is not an easy task, first you will have to find a good story and good characters to have the interest of readers, but you will also have to learn how to draw. And about the drawing, there are a lots of ways for them, it's a real art because it is the same as painting, there is many way to paint and different kind and it is the same for manga. A good example are the drawing of eyes, first you will have to chose a basic form and then you will have to pass the different emotion of your character trough them then you will have to learn the mecanics of corpse and physics basics and you will have to learn to draw the envirronement aroud the character wich is another kind of work like drawing buildings or park. The are lots of theories to learn about this art.
So here I try to explain to you why manga are made for everyone and every coutry and the different culture trough differents thematics and kind of stories. Moreover it is also a complete art trough the hard working you have to put inside to make just one page and the differents theory there is about the drawing and writting process.",0

It was interresting but a bit long and i had some exams to work on for the week after so i talked to my pharmacist about it and she said that if i finished my report before friday i could go home earlier.
So i spent the majority of my time working on that report and I didn't even go and speak with some patients because I was a bit in a hurry.
The subject of the report was interresting but not that much because we had to go really deep in the subject and so it was a bit difficult and long. For example we had to comment a lot of prescriptions with all the details about every drug : Initial indication, mecanism of action, side effects, adn everything else.
We also had to do like a therapeutical paper for the patients about one subject of our choice (still in dyslipidemias) so i did one about the risks of eating too much (especially about how it is impacting on the vessals, the bloodstream and the risks)  fat and how to change that, how to eat better, which products they have to avoid and which ones they have to prefer.
At the end of the week we had to make a presentation at the pharmacist about a subject of our choice. So i did it about how the lipids can bloke the blood in the vessals and how this formation can ""explode"" and relieve some toxins, proteins adn other bad things int hte blood stream or even destroy the vessal. Obviously this ends really bad. So i also had to give some solutions about the way of live because that is how people can reduce the risk : Better food, exercise ...

Indeed, that's not something which is abstract, the whole population can understand this idea.
I have had the chance to assist at some surgery like a 'sleeve', and I have directly known that's what I would like to do later. This surgery implies to be precise in a one hand and focus on your work in another hand. To make this dream of surgery possible, I watch some videos about this domain in order to understand the different protocole.
As for me, I knew that the surgery domain interested me but the training in different ward have confirmed my ambition to begin digestive surgeon. This training must be developed to permit for some people to find their vocation.
Furthermore, the cooperation of the practitioner must be more important because certains physicians didn't know what kind of support should be used to train us.",0
B2,B1,12.0,French,Medicine,4.0,2,7.0,Anglais,B1,weekly,,"The scientific discovery I want to talk about is vaccination. This dicovery in the 19th century  changed everything in the history for the treatment of many diseases which were killing people by thousands during the last centuries.
At the end of the 19th century, Alex Dupont took care of a little boy who has been bite by a dog with the rage. There were no hopes for this child at the time. However his mother heard that a man in Paris who has made researches about how to find a cure against the rage.
With all the scientific corpse against him he decided to try his experiment on the boy.
Actually, Alex Dupont discovered that when you inject a  sample of a virus or other things like that in animals (he worked on animals at the beginning), that animal could better resist to this virus when you were in contact with it latter. And this animals could actually survive.  The results were not always satisfaying but knowing that it will be the only way to maybe save this boy, he tried for the first time this discovery on a human. And it works.
The principle of the vaccination is about injecting a firts time the pathogen in the organisme (a very little quantity) that for the immune system recognize it and kill it. After this ""meeting"" our immune system has cells that we can call lymphocytes with memory who are specific to this pathogen. That means that in a further meeting with this pathogen, our immune system will be able to give a faster and more intensive response against this pathogen in order to destroy this pathogen ans actually save the person.
 To my opinion, the discovery of vaccination was a major step in the medical history to fight against some infectious diseases. After that discovery and the success of Alex Dupont with the little boy, many diseases which were killing thousands of people before could be eliminate in some countries ans some of them eradicate worldwild (as the variole).
Some people around the world critizise vaccination because  of the side effects that some vaccins could have. I don't think so. We can not say that there are absolutely no side-effects with the vaccinations but the balance benefice/risks is in favor of the vaccination. Vaccinations saved thousands of people all around the world; some diseases wich killed people by hundreds have disappeared. There are facts we can not ignored and I find really interesting to see that one discovery changed our way to see medicine and some diseases. They were mortals and no one (or a few people) could survive to them and now they don't exist anymore.
Nevertheless, vaccination works in a collective way, not in an individual one. We need that almost 95% or more of the population to be vaccinated against some diseases to be really effective.
With people against this, the ""vaccinal cover"" is sometimes not really effective for some illnesses in the country. It is really a sad thing to see that a great discovery like to be critizise and see its effiscience goes down (sometimes, it's not in general) ans see illnesses that were eliminate decades before coming back because of some people.",1

Actually, the surgeons won't operate themselves any more. There is one surgeon who managed the robot's arm in distance. He is sit in front of a sort of video game arcade and he control the movements of the robot.

One day she has to go to the internal revenue service. She has big problem with her business. But in the elevator, Alex Dupont (her husband) change is mind and talk about a big trouble in univers and ennemies. He said he was in an alternative univers. He was born in the firts univers, the alphaverse. Alex Dupont discover she has big power, she able to find power in other himself in alternative univers with spacial jump. The plot of the story was her daughter, she was the big ennemie and want to destroy all the univers.
I find this movie very crazy, it's a sci-fi movie but with an great story, it play very well with emotional and action time. The FX was very great and well-maked. I find the personnage were very interresting and with a good background story. I don't cry at the end but I have powerful feelings. I have to take a break and walk in the street to think about this experience.
Since Marvel has setting up the Marvel Cinematic Univers, the sci-fi and super-hero movies becommes more and more useless. Maybe the Alex Dupont wants to give a breath to the cinema of super-hero. The comedy side was perfect and not to much. It's note like the last Thor. Alex Dupont turn Alex Dupont into an useless god, with no real power except cry about the death of his family. I expect a new wave for the sci-fi movie, with serious subject and director. The potential it's infinit.

 By the end of Middle-Age, Alchemistry was a wide spread trend. People apprehended matter as divided into four categories (or elements), distinct one from the others. They distinguished “water”, “earth”, “fire”, and “air”. It was impossible to pass from one to the other, unless we used what people called a Philosopher Stone. Only this could allow you to turn something from one element into an other. Obviously, everyone wanted to discover this very special stone. In fact, it could not only transform silver in gold, but it could also heal any illness. It was a very valuable thing, but at the end, no one found the recipe and it became a legend. Step by step, as scientists made experiments, alchemistry slowly turned into what we now know as chemistry.
 One of the most famous experience that made alchemistry turn into chemistry is the experience of the grown tree. A Dutch scientist had the idea of putting a tree into a pot, and watering it. He started his experiment, assuming that water was of the “water” element, and the tree was of “earth” element since once it dies, it turns into dirt. That being set, he measured the weight of dirt in the pot, the weight of the tree itself and the amount of water he put everyday. I can’t recall the exact numbers, but after 5 years, he stopped the experiment, and measured again. The dirt in the pot was of almost the same weight, he had used a lot of water, and the tree had grown a lot, but not enough to meet with the weight of water used. He proved thereby the existence of what he called “Sylvester gas”, and destroyed the theory of matter divided into four elements. It was the first step to discover Photosynthesis.

In my opinion Biology was kind of like SVT in secondary. SVT was a courses who mean Science de la vie et de la Terre. In english we can translate as Science of life and Earth. We start study this when I was eleven. We study Geology, Genetic, some basic of medical science like inner-defense or some natural function like reproduction and of course some Biology stuff
Anyways we study a lot of different think and when I take my decision to go university I was thinking that'll study all those thing but in fact I start study a lot of different think but I wont talk about what I study in Biology now. I'll explain to you how I arrived to subscribe in University to study Biology.
 In a word I think I arrived in Biology by chance and if I want to be honest it's more because I'm lazy and at this moment I have no idea what I want to do in my life and I found a Biology University in Paris and I said to my self : why not, more or less everyone lose a year of is life why not me.
You probably lose the stream of my thought. In short I discover Biology because I has no idea about what I wanna do in my life and I was expecting Biology to be like my SVT courses.
 The discovery of Biology change my life like really. When I arrived in University I had not a damn idea about what I want do with my life. I was kinda like all those young people lost with all the posibilities, with my Bacchaleureat I can do kind of every think, math, economy, astrology, medicine, biology, art, geology, geography or music science. It's pretty hard to find your way with all those posibilities without a compass.
Anyways, I got lucky and find my way on my first choice. Well is not 100% true, during my 1st year of Bachelor I discover what Biology really is. It's the science of all living things. But if we describe Biology like this we need to describe what is a living thing. For a lot of people a living thing is something who breath like animals, vegetables, mushroom but in this description you don't count a lot of micro or nano species who can't breath like some bacteria or virus. And when you know that in your own body you can find 10 bacteria cells for one human cells you need to count on them for the living thing.
In this end I think that you can describe Biology like the science who try to understand how everything work like physic but in a different scale. Well I don't really answer to my first sentence why that wasn't 100% true. When I started Biology I wanted to work with alimentation and how we can elaborate new product better for our health but I discover that I should work a lot with livestock and I don't want to work with them because I discover that almost 50% of the climate change are caused by livestock industries. Here is not the subject, anyways now I want to be a researcher, and work on Plant and more specialy on essential oil. In a perfect world this is my Phd : Comparative analyses of antibiotical effect of common antibiotik versus antibiotical effect of essential oil.

But this last framework have disadvantage. it does not allow to develop powerful applications using the native functionalities of android and ios devices. Also  to develop an application, companies are obliged to recruit both android developers that ios to do the work. What costs is  expensive.
To resolve this problem, google has presented a new framework which name is Flutter at the Mobile World Congress from Monday, February 26 to Thursday, March 1, 2018 in Paris.
Flutter is Google's mobile UI framework for make high-quality native interfaces on iOS and Android in record time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and companies around the world, and is free and open source.
The framework has different features such as Hot Reload, which allows you to test your mobile application prototype more quickly. Flutter is available on all operating systems (Windows, Mac and Linux) and even on virtual machines (Visual Studio Code and Android Studio).
 It's a great innovation. Now, technology companies will no longer need to recruit android and ios developers  but rather a single developer who can use this tool to produce a robust application, powerful for the various terminals. The best part about flutter is that you have a wide range of widgets beautifully catalogued for you. Not only does it make it hassle-free but also helps you make a functionally amazing app. You use Dart language to write your Flutter app which is compiled to native code and generate ios and android version of your application. Google Flutter is a gift. Eye-catchy interface, faster app development process, flexible APIs  and few more features makes Google Flutter a mobile technology friendly tool.

They were in touch with the cow, and Alex Dupont concluded that the cow was the solution : the virus of the cow was called the vaccine, and he could prevent cowherd from the variola. He tried to transfered the substance from the cow to the human. He invented vaccination in 1796.
This discovery was a medicine revolution : we can prevent a desease and avoid it.
 The vaccination discovery was a revolution in medicine, for the better.
The medicine exists for cure and treat deseases. But it's better if people don't get sick ! It saves a lot of lives because we found a lot of vaccin against serious deseases such as diphtheria, tetanus or poliomyelitis, which could be mortals. So now, medecine can cure, treat and also prevent deseases !

Then, thanks to printer, people could acces to a book for themselves. Things changed and reading book alone at home became possible. From a social pratice, sharing became possible being solo. With that, the number of people who know how to read and write increased and personnal books scaled in the world. So, anybody who could and wanted to write a part of their personnal history, a brand new story or whatever, could be share with anybody who know how to read.

  During these last few years environment has taken a bigger place in our lives and this is one of the main challenge the world has to face in the future. In the same time the growth of the world’s population and  the travelling people around the world, push developers to explore different kinds of transports. How can we combine these two areas ? The Solar Impulse is one first step in what we can do with environment and transport.
  First of all, the first prototype of Solar Impulse was released in 2009. The main goal for its creators was to built a plane entirely autonomous in energy. The pane does not need any fossil fuel to fly, but only the energy offered by the sun. To convert this solar energy (radiation) into electricity, the wing’s plane are recovered by solar panels made of silicon. These wings are made of different layers. The photons presents in the sun radiation interacts with the electrons presents in the layers. Thanks to an intern process electricity is created. Finally, create electricity is not that hard ; but to being able to fly a long distance, the plane needs to create electricity in mass.
  In addition of producing electricity the plane has got an other challenge to face : autonomy which is directly linked to safety ; of course we do not want the plane to be forced to land in the ocean or in the Paris as the captain Alex Dupont did in 2009. At the beginning, the Solar Impulse could made only short travels and mostly during the day when there is more sun. It is true that they had to find a solution to being able to fly during the night when there is no sun at all. After few tries they decided to add big batteries (four) on the wings to stock the energy produced during the day but not used. That way they achieved their first world’s tour in July 2016. Finding a plane able to travel all around the world in an ecological way is  a real breakthrough. The next step today will be to built a Solar Impulse for commercial flight.
  Last but not least, the challenge of tomorrow is to create a plane on the Solar impulse’s model to transport passengers from a town to another, with a not to high cost.
  The problem today is that commercial planes are bigger and bigger and the rapport of their weigh and their surface is to short. In fact, if we want to transport as many people as in actual commercial flight, the future solar plane will need a huge surface to welcome a lot of solar panels. Of course such a weigh (plane and passengers) needs a big quantity of energy. Today all these challenges are not compatible and developers need to find THE idea which can change the future. As an aeronautic fan, I am looking forward for that day. It would be a date to remember for sure.

It isn’t actually very new because it exists for few years now. Indeed, PCR (PolyChain Reaction) was invented about a decade ago. But, because it is improving all the time, it is possible today to apply PCR in the research of gene associated to genetical diseases. First, we must understand how a PCR works. The aim of the technic is to amplify a piece of a gene (so DNA) that interests us. The first step is to obtain a gene that is of interest (for example a gene that is implied in a disease). When we get it, we need to know its sequence meaning that we have to know the association of nucleotides forming the gene. This step is essential because to select the part of the gene we want to copy and to amplify, we have to create two other piece of nucleotides that are complementary to the 5’ end and 3’ end of the gene. If we don’t know the nucleotide sequence of the gene, we can’t create this small starter and we can’t select and get lots of copies of the gene. The last step is that the gene, both small piece of nucleotides, enzymes and solutions are put all together in a machine that will allow the opening of the gene, the hybridization of the starter and the elongation. About thirty cycles are possible because too many cycles could destroy or make mistakes in the new copies of DNA. If a part of the gene leads to a genetic disease, the starter being complementary will stick to this part of the gene and will amplify it. Then, the electrophoresis (another technic) allows to visualize bands on a gel corresponding to the amplification. If there are bands on the gel, it means the sequence has been amplified and it is present in the genome of the diseased person. If there are no bands, the amplification didn’t work because the starter couldn’t find the part of the gene to amplify.
To my mind, the PCR technic is a must to have now in a laboratory. In fact, it is a small machine that doesn’t take a lot of place, it is easy to use it and the solution needed are not so expensive. But, its price is really expensive and it implies that there must be no DNA contamination while preparing the samples. I can understand that all laboratories can’t afford it.
  Also, I think that having the possibility to select a piece of a gene is a very interesting improvement for scientists and patients. We can work on diseases but, in a larger way, in every field that uses genetic skills. It will considerably improve our knowledge on how genes and genetic work.
  Finally, I really like working with PCR because it makes the analysis way much shorter than classical assays in tubes. Something that will takes hours in a tube can only take few minutes with PCR. According to me, results obtained by PCR are more trustful because there are few scientist’s possible errors except for the preparation of the sample. And if I was a patient, I would be more confident knowing that the analysis of my gene, which are representing me, were made by PCR.",1

In fact, people remember more informations and historical event when they play than they don't. Let's take an example with Assassin's Creed Origins, a video game which take place in Paris. This game modelise Paris as it was in Ptolemaic Kingdom (30 years before Alex Dupont).
The player take possession of a medjai, a protector of pharaons and the last of its kind. And throught his tinking, we can learn about the mentality of egyptian at this period. For exemple, it was very important to give a decent embalming of people who dead or the importance of keeping all part of the body in place else dead people can't go to egyptian's paradise. We can move freely in all Paris and in Paris, a Paris's region abandonned nowadays. When you saw this region now, you can recognize the place. We also have informations about Alex Dupont and her exil before she became a great queen.
In Assassin's Creed series, the second one is interresting too. You can know well about the Alex Dupont's familly because you have to be confront with them. We can meet Alex Dupont wich work on some engine that historian discover architecture's plans. In the game, Alex Dupont create these machine but for some reason we ignored, they never will be use. Historian doesn't understand why and the game try to give an answer with connecting all elements of the game.
A study shows that people who learn Paris history in class, find this annoying and remember less informations. However student that just play game of this type, can remember more informations but not always. The best combination is when the teacher keep an eye on student and supervise when they playing the game. Student remember significatively more informations by this way.
But these kind of games have limits because the developper add some interactions that make the game funny and not just a historical synthesis. This is why it's important to informate yourself before you will enjoy playing historical games.
What about history class ? Then, we can also have the same problems because what we teach can reveal as false in few years. It's all about the way we learn about something.",1

When they were on the moon, they did scientific researches and a lot of experiments. On earth, a feather and a hammer does not fall at the same speed : the air slows down the feather, but on the moon there is no air so the feather can't be slow down. Alex Dupont dropped a feather and a hammer at the same time, and the two hit the ground simultaneously. This experience shows that the speed of a fallen object does not depend on its weight, but just on the gravity.
Furthermore, the moon landing was live broadcast on TV in the Paris. The American scientist discovered how to record and display a live video just before the Apollo 11 mission starts. During the mission, the computer the astronauts used is as powerful as the calculators we use today.
Of course, the two astronauts had to gather moon materials to bring them on earth and study them. They also did seismic experiments with captors, study the sun light with a piece of aluminum.
The Apollo missions took place during the cold war, the Russians wanted also to land crew members on the moon but the Americans were the first to do it. On the other side, the Russians were the first to send a man into space.

Hops are an aromatic plant and it use on the beer to develop bitterness or to deliver aromatic oil to the beer. Normally, during the beer process, hops is add at the end of boiling step (15 minutes before the end). This method develop a bitter aroma because at this temperature all aromatic oils contains on hops is evaporate.
Now, the dry hopping consist to add hop pellets during the fermentation step. The temperature is around 15°C and aromatic oils stay on the beer. With this technique, we could create a lot of different taste. There is a lot of hops varietes with unique character.
The interresting part of this project was to test different hops with different yeast. The fermentation step need yeast who will eat sugar in the beer and producing alcohol. With the dry hopping, we add hop at the same time. During this experimentation, the development of flavor and aroma due to aromatic oil contains in hop pellets was totally different with the different yeast.
 Thanks to this experiment, the best yeast was identifie, the yeast who develop a stronger and good aroma. Because certain yeast develop a bad flavour and taste. Add hops pellets during the fermentation step with yeast permise to develop more aromatic oil contain on hops pellets. This results is really interresting, that means we could use less hops pellets and have the same aromatics oils quantites on the beer, the same flavour and aroma. The price of hops pellets is really expensive (40 euro for 100g and we need 1 g for 1L of beer) so it's a possibility to decrease the price of the production.
Another good point of this experimentation is the huge possibility to create new flavour and new aroma on the beer. There is a lot of hops varietes and a lot of yeast, we could test a lot of combinaison and discover new flavor. Hops is really an interresting climbing plant and I think it's the future of beer development.",0

Before all, a gene of interest in engineered in vitro usually in a bacterial system (Escherichia coli). For indirect transformation with A. tumefaciens, mostly used method, the engineered gene is then inserted in a plasmidic vector and introduced to A. tumefaciens. Thanks to a particular plasmid (Ti plasmid), existing only in A. tumefaciens species, the inserted gene can be transferred to the nuclear genome of host plant tissues (grown in vitro) sine they are exposed to each other. Plants can be regenerated from the transformed plant tissues and tested for the introduced gene expression.
The development of plant transgenesis technics revolutionized crop genetic improvement field. Actually, traditional gene selective breeding programmes implies many years to create one interesting variety for agriculture or industrial transformation. Whereas a gene delivery program can produce several enhanced varieties a year. Moreover, transgenesis enables researchers to introduce interesting transgenes originating from different kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Bacteria, …), a possibility that provides much more genetic diversity to improve crops.

  The transposable elements (TE, or more commonly called transposons) are mobile DNA sequences of variable length. The structure of a transposon is as follows : a central sequence is delimited at each side by repeated (identical) sequences. They can be classified into two main classes regarding the nature of those repeated sequences : (1) the DNA transposons which are delimited by terminal sequences orientated towards the same direction, and (2) the retrotransposons, for which the terminal sequences face each other. The difference between the DNA transposons and the retrotranposons also resides in the way they move in the genome. While the first ones move following a cut-and-paste process, the second ones are transfered to other regions of the genome following a copy-and-paste process.
The TEs can also be distinguished based on the content of their central sequence, which conditions their ability to move autonomously or not from their initial locus to a new one.
 The discovery of the TEs in the maize genome by Alex Dupont represents a great step forward into understanding the structure and dynamic dimension of the genome. It allowed scientists to finally understand how some genomes, no matter how close they were related one to another, could differ so much in their size. Indeed, the TEs make up for 50% of the human genome, and can represent up to 85 % of the big genomes of cereals.
Moreover, the dynamism of the TEs has surely played (and will keep playing) a great role in the evolution of species. Due to their ability to insert themselves into a random genomic region, they indeed can alter or even unactivate genes.",1

An experiment to understood this abstract concept is the analysis of light using diffraction. It is based on the fact that lights rays are emit by atoms when they desexcites, liberating energy. It goes to a final quantum state of energy from an initial quantum state and free energy under the form of a particle of photon, which is a no mass particle.
 The purpose of the experiment is to use the diffraction of the light emits by a hydrogen luminescent tube to find the quantification states of the hydrogen atom for each quantum number. This technique involve a goniometer, which is a device that diffract light with a network and then gives us the angular diffraction of fundamental rays of this particular light. Furthermore the atoms are excite by an electrical field, it passes in the tube filled with gaze of the element we are working on and by giving energy to them as so detestation appears as they cannot stay excite.
 First to start on the hydrogen state of energy we need to find a crucial parameter: the number of string of the network that diffract the light. So we know the light rays he emits by the mercury element and can retrace their wave length, we are using a mercury luminescent tube to determine the parameter. Thanks to a physical formula including this wave length, the number of string and the sinus of the angle of the diffracted light obtained by the goniometer, we are able to approach this number and continue the experiment.
 In a second time, we replace the mercury tube by a hydrogen one and repeat the process through the goniometer. At this time we are just able to pick up the values of the angle of the rays and using the same formula as the first part of this experiment we can calculate the final wave length.
 Moreover other formulas of physics help us is our research of the values of energy as well as Energy=(Plank constant*speed of light)/wave length. The energy here is the variation between the initial and the final state and using mathematical deductions we found the values of energy for each state of quantum number for the hydrogen atom.
 This was a very interesting experiment to work on.",1

The experiment I am currently working on is the audiogenic seizure. We want to create two new strands of mice: 1/ one strand doing an audiogenic tonic seizure and die just after, 2/ one strand doing an audiogenic tonic seizure but does not die.
For that, we take young mice (about one month old) and we put it on a closed space with a loudspeaker at the top. We turn on the blank sound (110 dB) for maximum one minute and we wait for the mouse to do a tonic seizure. If the mouse does not react, we have to sacrifice it. If it reacts, we keep it and mark it on its ear. If the mouse dies, we ventilate it to resuscitate it.
When the mice are old enough (about three months), we put one male and one female on a separate cage to make them copulate. Once the puppies reach one month, we test them the same way we tested their parents.
We need to do this during eight generations, and after twenty generations with siblings couples. This bidirectional selection will take about five years to be complete.
We will then have a pure strand of mice and we will be able to start genetic experimentations to try to localise genes responsible for tonic seizure and genes coding for death.
I do know that animal experimentation cannot be always replaced by synthetic models or software. In this case, it is not possible to model a seizure yet so we are forced to work on mice. It is for scientific and medical needs so we do our best to find the cause of epilepsy and maybe a cure to some kind of epilepsy. Because, yes, a lot of different epilepsy exist. It takes plenty of time to take care of an animal facility. We try to make our mice the less stressed as much as possible. But still, it is every time a heartbreak to sacrifice some of our mice. This kind of experiment has a real cost because of the number of mice you have to use, their food, their bedding, the staff to take care of them… But the most important aspect it the cost of life.

First of all, Apple is well know for their very expensive phone and this year doen't break the rule. The cheapest version of this IPhone will cost around one thousand euros, an augmentation of two hundred euro from the last version.
The first argument Apple said to explain this price is that the augmentation of cost of all the materials required during the fabrication. Somehow, some experts explain that this augmentation is not as high as the difference of price with the last version of the IPhone.
This new version of the IPhone also come with a ""better"" camera. The IPhone will be able to take photo with a very high quality. But this is not a innovation, the last IPhone and other cheapest phone take photos with a very good quality. I don't think the camera has to be upgrade from the last version.
Apple also talk about the new software that will be used by the new IPhone. This software has a lot of new functionnality that I think is completly useless. For example, you can make a emoji based on your face. The front camera is also invisible when not used. I think this functionnality doesn't justify the augmentation of price of this IPhone.
For a more global opinion, all the version of the IPhone are not so different. I think that Apple wants to sell a new IPhone each year with new useless functionnality. My opinion is that Apple sells very bad phone but with a too much high price. Apple use its notority of a fake wealth socity to sell their phone, and some people buy their new phone each year because they want to show their are rich.
Apple is an expert for selling things that are not wroth that price. For exemple if you check the Apple webmarket, you can find wireless headphone for around two hundred euros or weels for your computers at one hundred euros.
It's very easy to find some alternatives to the IPhone, some phones with the same performance and functionnality will cost you around four hundred euros against one thousand. Some other phone comes with more usefull functionnality or other method of production to justify their price. For example, phones that only make by recycling other phones.

First of all, let me introduce Alex Dupont. Alex Dupont is a Swiss rapper who comes from Paris. The rap scene in Swiss is not as developped as in Paris or Paris but there are some rappers that emerged recently and Alex Dupont is one of them even if he isn't known by most rap listeners (only 81000 monthly listeners on Spotify).
Makala published Radio Suicide on the 21st of June 2019. The album contains 21 tracks and last 1 hour and 9 minutes. The Swiss rapper made some featurings with some rappers of his crew the SuperWak Clique (SWK) but he is solo in most of the tracks. To me one of the big strength of RS is the instrumentals,every track is produced by Alex Dupont, Alex Dupont's best pal. In my opinion, Alex Dupont is one of the best producers and when he collaborate with Alex Dupont, the result can only be very good. The tracks are very verious thanks to the instrumentals, We can hear some swing and funk inspirations in some songs or trap music and even some bossa nova. You can't get bored during the album because it is a trip around the world.
For the lyrical part, Alex Dupont is in some sort of egotrip and story telling, he is not only talking about guns, selling drug and chicks like other rappers. Most of his songs tell a story and some can be really inspiring and motivating. Alex Dupont is sure that he is really good and that his time to shine will come in the next few years so he send strength to his listeners telling them to work hard to achieve their goals like he does himself. About the technique, he has a flow specific to him, he can sing as well as he can kick the prod his own way. Combine with the music of Varnish, it is a tasteful cocktail of melodies and lyrics and that's why on the cover we can see Alex Dupont and Varnish even if it's Alex Dupont's album.
Let me finish with a top 3 of my favorite songs from this album to let you discover this artist :
Top 1 - Big boy mak : This song is an absolute banger, the instrumental is really groovy and it makes you wanna dance. There is also a clip on youtube that is very well made.
Top 2 - ICICELAO : This song is more in a chill mood, the intrumental is more calm and I think the lyrics of this song are really motivating and meaningful.
Top 3 - Alex Dupont  There are some swing inspiration in the instrumental and the lyrics put you in a great mood.
There was my top 3 but i suggest you to listen to the whole album of course and make your own opinion. That's all folks. Have a great time listening to this :)",1

Now let's find a subject that can be link with the communication field... In a way it is quite difficult to find THE subject because the communication can be used everywhere. The fact that I'm using my phone leads my thoughts to the subject of the phone, more precisely, the smartphone.
Our smartphone is a kind of super tool, a small computer in our pocket. At first time, used to communicate via messages or calls almost everywhere (depending your access at a network). Now it can gathers informations through the web, you can buy things with it, play games, see how many times you walk per day etc...

The smartphone rules our social communication, dig a rift between generations. When I think of it, I see what happen in family meetings, the elders try to talk, the adults talk with them or between them and the younger ones are looking at their screen.

Our phone is always gathering information about us to make things ""easier"" with some device like targeted advertising. Ect... Let's give my impressions about it in the next text.
 Now let's give my opinion on the phone. I already gave some consequences of it in the last text.
Personnaly I don't like smartphone, and that for a lot of reasons.

A second reason is about videogames. Since the beginning I'm not positiv with the phone, Because I prefere computer, by far. And as a gamer I can't consider phone as a game interface.

Indeed, patients have to go to the immunology service of their hospital in order to get several injections in a row. Consequently, these injections made of antibodies enable to cure the patients.
Unfortunatly, this method has not been very developped first of all due to its price but also because it requires specialized staff and specific equipment. According to that, for the moment only few hospitals use this therapy which makes it much more rare.
Nonetheless, it seems to be obvious that more experiments of this therapy should be done on other kind of diseases in order to spread this method of curing patients with as less risks as possible.
 In my opinion, immunotherapy is the future of pharmacy because until right now no disadvantages (except probably the price) have been discovered. Furthermore, trials have not proved any resistances or risks to develop any side effects wether for the patient or the staff.",1

There were many bodybuilders that everybody knows like Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont, they were beasts. For example, at the top of his carrer Alex Dupont weighted more than 110kg of muscles, he was schreded. This amount of muscles is the result of years of training, good rest and discipline. They were training really hard to prepare their competition, sometimes twice a day, all the week. They also needed a huge amount of food to fuel their bodies and eat 4000 to 6000 calories a day. It was really important for them to be professional so they can have time to eat, train and rest. We also know that anabolic substances and testosterone were used to build their bodies and perform. Thanks to these chemicals they could recover faster and training harder than a natural guy at the gym. Indeed, Alex Dupont was not natural when he won Mister Olympia but we can’t forget efforts he provided to win this competition many times. Secondly, we will talk about myths that all people believe. Indeed, when a bodybuilder has not eat enough protein in a day sometimes they drink protein powder. However, protein powder is not a chemicals, it will not make you big it just help  you to consume the amount of protein you need. It is only useful if you are already eating enough and proper food. Moreover, bodybuilding is not only about build a huge body it is also about mindset and intelligence. Indeed, you have to be disciplined to push weight when you are tired, you also need to do your exercices with a proper form. Several people get bad injuries because of their bad form. So you really need to be conscientious about what you are doing. Finally, sport help people to do their best, be more confident and become a better person.

To be a perform deep learning program, you need a very large database but if you don't have a database, the program can create its own one. For exemple AplhaGo played against itself to learn new techniques and become more stronger.
So, AlphaGo is one of the most famous application of deep learning, but this way of programming has many applications in every domain.

One of them that makes me suspicious are the GMOs. There are plants, or parts of plants, which are modified by humans to earn special characteristics for example not to died because of pesticides, to resist to insects of predators, not to suffer from the hot or the sun, etc. It also could be modified animals ou any alive modified system. But we have working on plants exclusively. I can give examples of using :
- In developing countries, mostly poor countries like in Africa for instance, there are special rizes that are made to become more nutritional for peoples, and to prevent for diseases like diarrhea.
- There is a kind of OGMs invented to resists to pesticides not to died when farmers use it to destroy unwanted plants.
GMOs are really controlled by European (EFSA) and French (ANSES) control agencies of respect of environnement. In fact, in Paris, OGMs are not authorised to be sold, because the government and scientists criticize the impact on health and environment. They explain they don't have enough hindsight, that there are not affirmations like ""OGMs are safe"" or ""OGMs are dangerous"". Thinkings and opinions seem to be quite differents and perhaps influenced by lobbying and laboratories that want OGMs to be commercialized.
As far as I am concerned, I think I have to show my two points of view.
First, as a scientific student, I'm asking myself about diseases and the influence of OGMs on cancers and degenerative diseases. Maybe OGMs could modified our own genes, our own bacteries? Perhaps I could become allergic? And what about the environment? Studies seem to show that the special culture of thoses plants could affect the ground for many years.
Then, as a common person, by the way, I am a little bit scared by introducing new kind of food in my alimentation routine. Furthermore, one of the key purpose of this innovation is the price. As a student, I sometimes have to make both ends meats simply to be able to eat everyday, so I don't think the cost would be accessible for me. Moreover, what about the taste ?
